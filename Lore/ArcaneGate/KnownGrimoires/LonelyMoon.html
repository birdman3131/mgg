          <p><strong>Description:</strong> A Grimoire consisting of lunar magic combined with the concept of loneliness. Lunar magic is versatile and capable of performing many types of spells without excelling in any particular category. Lunar magic’s special property is that it is effective against most other types of magic.</p>
          <p>This Grimoire in particular contains magics altered by loneliness, giving them the additional properties of curse magic and further enhancing the anti-magic capabilities of all spells within. Additionally, due to the concept of loneliness being applied, some spells have additional or altered effects related to the concept.</p>
          <p>“<i>Alone in this darkness, serene moonlight turns cursed, for what is loneliness if not a poison?”</i></p>
