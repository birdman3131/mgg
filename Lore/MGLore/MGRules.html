<p>“revealing the personal identity of another Magical Guardian without their permission is one of the few universal taboos Guardians have agreed upon. While not an official rule, there are Guardians that would go out of their way to punish anyone who does such a thing out of malice.”&nbsp; Selene ch.15</p>
<p><br>Never ask a Yellow what their wish was.</p>
<p><br>Darks are to never tell other types what their actual Origin is.</p>
<p><br>“Guardians are very private about their exact level, stats, and Skills. As such they have decided to adopt a policy of only revealing their general level. The only exception to this rule is when you team up with other Guardians, but even then, only an accurate summarization of your abilities is expected.” Selene ch.27</p>
<p><br>MG healers have strict rules on patient confidentiality that without express permission under no circumstance are they to share any information they observe in the process of healing another MG. In addition any MG they heal can request they sign a geas.</p>
<p><br>MG are to stay out of each other’s private lives. (Not always followed)</p>
<p><br>When needing to move quickly around urban areas MG are required a minimum of 100 but&nbsp; recommended 150 Dex for roof jumping. If running on the street, they are to stay in the bike lane and follow traffic laws and signals, and It is the job of the MG with highest Dex to avoid collisions.</p>
<p><br>MG get discounts at businesses marked with a specific symbol when they are in costume. Green gives a 10% discount on all purchases.</p>
<p>Red gives a flat $5 off of one purchase a day in addition to the 10% discount.</p>
<p>Most businesses have the green one while cafes, and sweets shops frequently having the red.</p>
<p>MG are recommended avoid taking advantage of the $5 discount at the same business every day but instead go to a variety of places.</p>
<p><br>MG are to avoid dealing with any crime they see when in public instead leaving it for the police to handle. The police may request assistance at times but that is to be left to high level MG.</p>
