<p>“Fighting is about half of the job. The other half is a mix of patrolling, training, managing your fame, and promoting peace, hope, and joy. Or any other positive emotion, really, but those are considered the major three.”</p>
<p>“There are multiple ways Magical Girls go about it, but it all more or less boils down to being an ‘idol’ of some sort. Some do exactly that, going the traditional route and performing concerts. On the other end of the spectrum, some Guardians stream their battles against the Anathema. Livestreaming has become popular for a variety of activities, actually, and some Guardians engage in everything from playing video games to hosting talk shows. There’s virtually a limitless amount of ideas, but it all boils down to making people feel safe and happy.” Ever Ch.30</p>
<p><br>“Outside of combat, most Magical Guardians find a duty to perform for citizens. Many of us share our hobbies as a way to both relax ourselves and accomplish the goal of easing their minds.” Ever ch.30</p>
<p><br>“Some Guardians prefer to be completely off the radar and fight without gathering any attention. This method, however, does mean they earn less points. The System offers plenty of quests for helping civilians out, and although you might not get many at once, it adds up. You also earn a small amount of experience for inspiring people, but you are unlikely to notice it except at the early levels or if you perform something like a large concert.” Ever ch.30</p>
<p><br>“As you become more famous or powerful, it’s natural you’ll develop a fanbase. Things like commercials, merchandise deals, interviews, cameos, and other such experiences are all things we have to deal with. Be aware that as a Magical Girl you’ll be under a microscope when you’re seen in public. Anything problematic you do could have more than just a detrimental effect on your social status but also on the population’s emotional status as a whole. We are in the business of building hope, not fear.” Ever ch.30</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Patrol:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a fancy way of saying we’re going to walk around the city being seen by people. It makes people feel safer, and it keeps us mobile in case a Usurpation happens.” Ever ch.30</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Crafters:</u></strong></p>
<p>“Crafting/non-combat focused Magical Girls get experience passively from whatever they make being used. The more it is used and better the item, the more experience they get. It doesn't siphon any exp if a Magical Girl is using the item. They also can get exp for just the act of making something, but it's usually a small amount unless the item is really amazing. This hasn't been gone into yet, but you can get Class experience by doing whatever it is you class makes you good at. That class exp also transfers a small amount to your actual level as well. So healers can just level up by healing people, crafters just by making things.</p>
<p>There is, however, one way crafter level up quickly involving forming a special type of party.</p>
<p>Basically, the crafter can provide a Magical Girl with a crafted item (or the government, and they then pay the Magical Girl with something else) and then they form a Contractual Party. Normally, experience is divvied up among parties based mostly on kill participation, only some of the exp forcibly being shared. In a Contractual Party, the System basically recognizes the Crafter is being paid for a rendered service, and shunts the majority of the exp their way.</p>
<p>So Crafters always have the option of selling their goods to a MG, then sitting back while said MG power levels them by killing Anathema.” Mikasane Discord.&nbsp;</p>
