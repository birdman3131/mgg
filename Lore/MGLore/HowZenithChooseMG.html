<p>If a person is “compatible with magic and be capable of serving in a vital role as a Magical Guardian.” A familiar will be created.</p>
<p>Said familiar will then “gather more information and perform a final assessment”. Known sources of info being all possible info that could be found on an electronic device. as well as by physically following the potential MG for a time, and using some unspecified magic. (Selene followed Mai for 23 days before the emergency contract so we don’t have a good idea the info gathering stage normally lasts.)</p>
<p>Of note the only place that isn’t monitored is inside of the potential MG’s home, hough any online activity still is recorded.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Known criteria:</u></strong></p>
<p>Being compatible with magic. (Mai had a “mana resonance of 124% when first contracted)</p>
<p>Being willing to fight the Anathema and would use their powers to do so.</p>
<p>Not being the type of person to abuse their power.</p>
