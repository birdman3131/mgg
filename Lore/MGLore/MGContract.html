<p>“There are three stipulations to the contract. The first is by and large the biggest reason people do not accept. In becoming a Magical Guardian, you pledge to use your powers to fight the Anathema and protect humanity in its struggle. This means for the rest of your life, your fate will be entangled with pain, suffering, and death. You must realize that you cannot be a light in the darkness without immersing yourself in those very same shadows. Even should you not fight the Anathema directly, you will still be working in some way to alleviate the suffering they cause, and in doing so, expose your very soul to the tragedies of a war without end.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch3">ch.3</a></p>
<p>“The second condition is more vague, but it states that you will not abuse your new powers. Things such as needlessly harming other humans, hampering other Magical Guardians without reason, or using your power in a tyrannical manner. You are expected to be a beacon of hope, not a monster. This rule is more flexible due to its far-reaching nature, and warnings will be given if it is perceived you are potentially breaking it.” Selene ch.3</p>
<p>“The third and final stipulation, is that you agree that no matter what, you will not attempt to break the laws of magic. There are a few, but they simply cover what you can and can’t use certain magics for. Time and mind magic would be examples. Generally, don’t actively try to destroy reality or enslave another, and you’ll be fine. A more detailed explanation will be provided if necessary.” Selene ch.3</p>
<p>“Know that breaking any of these stipulations is grounds for the stripping of your power and any assets you may have acquired during your time as a Magical Guardian. If all three stipulations are agreeable, then I will ask my question one last time, and you will answer.” Selene ch.3</p>
