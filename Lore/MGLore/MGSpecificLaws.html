<p><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Blacklight Protocols:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>Created by earthling politicians against the recommendations of the Zenith, because a large number of them bought into the rumors surrounding Darks.</p>
<p>“makes it so no new Dark Magical Girl could use their Astral Shift without first meeting another Guardian in person and getting their permission.” Error <a href="/redirects/ch21">ch.21</a></p>
<p><br>“The official reasoning. Is that it’s a measure to prevent potentially unstable candidates from immediately going and abusing the massive amounts of power they are granted. There was an incident, you see, where a Dark Magical Girl’s first act after becoming a Guardian was to do something… terrible. Ever since, all Dark Magical Girls have to receive in-person permission from another Guardian before they use their first Astral Shift. This is a human rule, and although the Zenith argued against it, they believed it would be inappropriate to go against the wishes of humanity’s chosen representatives.” Selene ch.21</p>
<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Guardian Immunity:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>Makes Guardians legally immune to prosecution for most non-violent crimes.</p>
<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Guardian Diplomatic Protections Act:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>“Each Guardian has, for all intents and purposes, the same legal rights as their own sovereign nation. It was decided by Earth nations that trying to legally restrict people with almost unlimited capabilities for destruction was a bad idea, especially when they were chosen as protectors by a vastly superior alien race. Instead, the current stance of most nations could be best described as appeasement: Don’t interfere with Magical Guardians and give them whatever they ask for within reason.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch15">ch.15</a></p>

<p><strong><u>Other:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MG theoretically hold a special military rank that is equivalent to a captain in the army.</p>
<p><br>If a MG gets sued the government will protect them and cover all costs including fines if they lose the case.</p>
