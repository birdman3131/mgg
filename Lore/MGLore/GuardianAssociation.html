<p>“At its core, the GA is the international organization that coordinates humanity’s war against the Anathema and is directly in command of <a href="/Lore/GeneralLore/MagicalSoldiers">Magical Soldiers.</a> While they work with us Guardians and provide aid, we do not fall under their direct authority.” Ever ch.28</p>
<p>“Guardian Command is mostly made up of normal people too, not Guardians. Generals, analysts, strategists, and others with many years of experience make more sense to be in charge than a Magical Guardian who only got their power in their teens.” Naiad ch.28</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Contracts with MG:</u></strong></p>
<p>The MG gets bonus points as well medivac, reinforcements, magical support, and sponsored time contracted healers.</p>
<p>In return the MG are to follow deployment orders.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Known to house:</u></strong></p>
<p><br>Facilities for operators (MG and non) to direct anti Anathema operations (both MG and Magical Soldiers).</p>
<p><br>Ritual rooms to boost the powers of long range support type MG (such as Error Machina)</p>
<p><br>Equipment necessary to safely unlock test and analyze MG’s Signature Magic.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Operators:</u></strong></p>
<p>Both MG and regular people can be Operators, and are expected to be able to. “Coordinate the various Guardians, Magical Soldiers, and police forces. though more than just direct forces. Research, analysis, drone support, and even acting as a communications network between teams all fell under the duties expected of an operator.” Error ch.22</p>
