<p>Some MGs are loners. &nbsp;Some MGs are organized into teams. &nbsp;The only team names we know of are <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Teams/FantasyFatale">Fantasy Fatale</a> and <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Teams/MagicalCakes">Magical Cakes</a>.</p>
<p>Some MGs belong to guilds. &nbsp;The only guild we currently know the name of is Maid Cafe.</p>
<p>The only two teams we have seen have four members. &nbsp;We do not know if all teams have four members, however when the MGs were attacking the Anathema heading back to the shielding station in <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch.25</a>, they were in “groups of four to eight.”</p>
<p>The benefit of being a member of a team is obvious; &nbsp;we do not know what guilds do for their members.</p>
