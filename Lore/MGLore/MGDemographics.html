<p>The first MGs were created just over 21 years ago. &nbsp;MGs are grouped into seven year long “generations”. &nbsp; These are as arbitrary as grouping people by decades.</p>
<p>Mika posted the following in #word-of-god in discord, and added to it later.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Please note the following numbers are what I use as REFERENCE. They may be adjusted in the future up to the point where they are officially mentioned in the story. Generally, about <strong>1,632</strong> new magical girls are added per year. About <strong>1,386</strong> (198 x 7) of them end up attending one of the schools, the rest are mentored, run solo, or attend the next year depending when they were added. There have been <strong>34,624</strong> contracts. Only <strong>18,620</strong> are still active duty. <strong>5,103</strong> are “retired.” This leaves <strong>2,660</strong> per region roughly. Each Sanctuary city accounts for almost <strong>300</strong> Guardians, not counting recruits, but worldwide portal network lets them deploy quickly.</p>
  <p>As for current generational Numbers (each magical girl generation is denotated by a 7 year period):<br>1st Gen: 3,253 + 907 Retired (Generation: Hero)<br>2nd Gen: 6,602 + 2,805 Retried (Generation: Warrior)<br>3rd Gen: 8,765 + 1,391 Retired (Generation: Idol)<br>4th Gen: 1,386 (Current Gen, no name)</p>

  <p>(Directly from my notes, numbers may be off because they're estimates anyway) <strong>1st Gen: 3,253 + 907 Retired (Generation: Hero)</strong> 11,424 contracted, 7,414 dead over 21 years (353 per year) [36.4% Survival Rate] <strong>2nd Gen: 6,602 + 2,805 Retried (Generation: Warrior) </strong>11,424 contracted, 2,317 Dead over 14 years (165.5 per year) [78% Survival Rate] <strong>3rd Gen: 8,765 + 1,391 Retired (Generation: Idol)</strong> 11,424 contracted, 1,268 dead over 7 years (181 per year) [89% Survival Rate] <strong>4th Gen: 1,386 (Current Gen, no name/theme decided)</strong></p>
  <p>Note that the 18,620 figure is the total for the first three generations. &nbsp;None of the current generation is in that figure.</p>
  <p>(Note also that this means the Breakdance, although an MG for less than a year, is in the 3rd, not the 4th gen.)</p>
  <p>34,624 contracts - 18,620 active duty - 1,386 new recruits - 5,103 “retired” = 9,515 dead</p>
