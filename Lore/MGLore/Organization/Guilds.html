<p>Some MGs are members of guilds.</p>
<p>Mika gave us a list of the top ten guilds on discord, 09/19/2024 1:15 AM</p>
<p>"Current Names for some of the top ten Magical Girl Guilds (Minor Spoilers):</p>
<p>Maid Cafe</p>
<p>Dawnsong&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friend Zone&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conquistadorks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morning Star&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crossing Guard&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sugar Rush&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nightlight&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guardian Angels"</p>
<p>We know nothing about any of these except that Maid Cafe contains team <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Guilds">Magical Cakes</a>.</p>
<p>We do not know what benefits or disadvantages belonging to a guild gives MGs.</p>
<p>There is an MG named <a href="/Characters/SugarRush">Sugar Rush</a>; &nbsp;obviously this is not the same as the guild.</p>
