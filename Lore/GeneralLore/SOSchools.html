<p>“SO students were a sort of unique phenomenon in Sanctuary Cities. They only went to a normal school half the week before heading to a specialized school the second part. Mostly, it was for students who both already decided what profession they wanted to pursue and had some sort of special circumstance. Things like surviving a brutal Usurpation, losing family, or having the highest level of grades for the school entrance exams were ways to get offered a spot. Supposedly, it helped the brightest of students excel in their field and also gave the unfortunate ones a chance to thrive.</p>
<p>SO stands for ‘Special Offering’.</p>
<p>SO schools were known for producing some of the most experienced graduates and were highly coveted. My brother had gotten into one designed around magitech engineering due to his grades, and he was already working at a company as a paid intern with a promise of employment upon graduation.” Mai <a href="/redirects/ch29">ch.29</a></p>
<p>The SO schools meet on Thursday through Saturday.<br><br>“SO schools help as a sort of smoke screen for Magical Girls, allowing those who wish to keep their private identities secret a legitimate way of hiding what they are. The unique blend of a normal school environment combined with specialized learning helps produce well-rounded individuals for both SO students and Guardians.” Ever ch.29</p>
