<p>All shelters are built with two sets of double doors with a room in between, used as airlocks in case of survivors. Said room is built as a kill box with sensors and weapons to make sure any Anathema are killed. (Silverite gas in normal shelters adding 2 20mm Gatling turrets in <a href="/Lore/GeneralLore/MegaShelters">Mega Shelters</a>). &nbsp;All shelters in Arcadia have cameras capable of seeing through invisibility.</p>
<p>Ordinary shelters are not manned by police, unlike <a href="/Lore/GeneralLore/MegaShelters">mega shelters</a>. &nbsp;The ones at the <a href="/Locations/Arcadia/TheMall">mall</a>, for example, are manned by mall security guards.</p>
<p><br>Inside the shelter there is a console that can view and control most of the functions of the shelter such as, External cameras, and microphones. It also access to information on how many people were in the shelter, temperature controls, and food and water rationing calculations.</p>
<p>But most importantly the ability to turn on the emergency shield.</p>
<p><br>When the button to turn on the emergency shield is pressed the warning message “Engaging the shelter’s emergency shield system will prevent any person from entering or leaving until rescue arrives. Please do not engage unless the automated threat system is nonfunctional and the outer door has been breached. Activating this system without cause may be prosecutable in court. To confirm activation of the emergency shield, please press and hold the accept button for five seconds,” is played.</p>
<p><br>Shelters are powered primarily by external mana generators, if those fail the main functions can be powered by the city’s power grid not including the emergency shield. They also have internal batteries that can power everything including the emergency shield but will only last for a limited amount of time if all other sources fail.</p>
<p><br>“Deactivating an emergency shield requires both an authorized person and the physical unlocking key that can only be made at Guardian Command.” Error<a href="/redirects/ch16"> ch.16</a> (to keep MG from doing something dumb.)</p>
<p><br>The emergency shield cuts off all access to the shelter including but not limited to, outside power sources, air, and sound. And cannot be turned off from the inside.</p>
<p><br>If the shield is activated and all possible power sources are drained the shield will drop and the doors will open.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Glad to see both returning readers and new readers enjoying things so far! I saw there was some questioning about why the emergency shield can't be deactivated once active. While it didn't make it into the story to avoid description bloat, the reason is that the shield itself is magitech, or more specifically, technology is being used to both cast and reinforce a spell that creates a shield. Magic in this universe is very heavily tied to concepts and the metaphysical. By having a shield that CAN'T be turned off when activated, it increases the strength of the spell by reinforcing the concept of it being "unbreakable." Adding an on/off toggle to the spell would significantly weaken its strength.<br><br>Partially tied to this reason is the fact that this spell is so powerful it actually fries the magitech after being used, requiring it to be replaced afterwards. Hopefully that explanation helps, and if you're wondering if this explanation will make it into the story eventually, it will! Just much later on.</p>
