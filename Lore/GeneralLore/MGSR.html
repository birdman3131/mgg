<p>“A widely popular game designed to mimic many aspects of being a Magical Guardian. Monsters in the game are based on Anathema, players use characters based on actual Guardians, and the stats that are managed directly resemble the stats Guardians possess in reality. For this reason, many attempts are made to get Guardian candidates to play the game. It was determined that giving Guardian candidates a very rare character choice not only incentivized them to continue playing but also allowed us to see what style of character you would play as. In a way, the entire game is a soft way to scout out the capabilities and mindsets of candidates without any real world risk.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p>Selene complemented Mai for doing well without paying real money, indicating it is possible to pay real money to do better in the game. &nbsp;ch. ?</p>
