<p>Found in the 7 mega cities. Create a shield over a large area that makes it harder for Reality Usurpations to form. Under normal circumstances the shield makes it so there is a minimum 30 minute warning before a Usurpation begins.</p>
<p><br>The events of vol.1 caused a significant reduction in the amount of warning given before Usurpations, down to only 15 minutes, as well as decreasing the effectiveness of the shield. Before there was only about 6 per month, now several a day but they are generally smaller, low level, and weaker.</p>
<p><br>“Shielding stations have a secondary function. If a shelter activates its emergency shield, the shielding station can power it indefinitely. If there is no shielding station to power it, shelters have batteries that can last nine to ten hours (in Arcadia, at least) before they run dry. When this happens, the shelter opens up as it can no longer maintain basic life support functions. Normally, such a situation wouldn’t be an issue in Arcadia. Most Usurpations don’t take longer than an hour or two to clear out, and even the trickier ones only take around five.” Error ch. Forum Interlude.</p>
