<p>In addition to the usual means of transport, there is some teleportation possible. &nbsp;The Guardian Spires all have teleportation ritual rooms, as do some other locations (Mikasane #mgg-general 11/11/2024 1:12 PM), and some MGs have the ability to teleport themselves and others (Mikasane #mgg-general 9/10/2023 11:55 AM).</p>
<p>Most MGs do not teleport; &nbsp;for example, <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Teams/FantasyFatale">Fantasy Fatale</a> uses a helicopter to get around.</p>
<p><a href="/Locations/Arcadia">Arcadia</a> has an extensive subway and monorail network.</p>
