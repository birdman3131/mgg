<p>“Actions that may otherwise be illegal can be sanctioned if determined to be a reasonable measure used to survive the Usurpation” Ji-woo ch.14</p>
<p>“As long as it is used to combat the Anathema. Even damaging a building is nothing to worry about and is hand-waved so long as it isn’t excessive. Governments have long since set up funds to take care of such things. Legally speaking, you have nothing to worry about.” Selene ch.9</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Tampering with shielding stations:</u></strong></p>
<p>Not much is said about these laws beyond them being “<i>quite </i>clear”, and having severe consequences for anyone, and everyone no matter their credentials. (Implied that even MG will face severe consequences for tampering with them.) ch. 29</p>
<p><strong><u>Felony shelter operation</u></strong></p>
<p>Activating the emergency shield against the automated system’s recommendation, resulting in civilians or rescue personnel being put into danger, injured, or killed. &nbsp;Penalties are a hefty fine and a maximum of ten years imprisonment. ch 29.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Other:</u></strong></p>
<p>Generally any injuries caused by or because of Anathema are covered.</p>
