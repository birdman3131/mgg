<p>“Being manaborn simply means you were exposed to mana at a young age or during your fetal stage. Being manaborn gives you a much higher natural amount of mana in your body than a normal human, causing the vibrant eyes and sometimes different hair colors. The eyes are the window to the soul, as it were, so a person with more magical energy in them would naturally have different eyes due to the conceptual link.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch23">ch.23</a></p>
<p><br>Manaborn have eyes that shine with a bright, unnatural, vibrant gleam.</p>
<p><br>Have a higher than normal tolerance to high ambient mana levels.</p>
<p><br>Have a 50/50 chance of ending up with a variety of health issues.</p>
