<p>A material developed by the Zenith specifically to combat Anathema.</p>
<p><br>In bullets it is referred to as Silverbane.</p>
<p>“Silverbane bullets are made of special alloys that are complete poison to Anathema. Simply put, Anathema form their bodies of corrupted mana, pulling it into a framework. Silverbane ammunition specifically resonates in a way that rips apart this framework, destroying them at a base level. Even if the bullet does not hit any “vital” areas, the creature is still destabilized significantly. In other words, with these bullets, almost every hit will still do significant amounts of damage.” Selene ch.6</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Common uses:</u></strong></p>
<p>Bullets. (Standard carry for magical soldiers/wardens).</p>
<p><br>Aerosolized. (Shelter entrance kill boxes).</p>
<p><br>Fortifications such as doors being made of Silverite.</p>
