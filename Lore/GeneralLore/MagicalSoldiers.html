<p>Magical soldiers are non-contracted humans that are given the training and weapons necessary to fight the anathema.</p>
<p>They are professional soldiers, and are directly commanded and operated by guardian command.</p>
<p>For some reason they have the acronym MSD. &nbsp;Selene, <a href="/redirects/ch6">ch. 6</a></p>
<p><br>“The Wardens are the elite, special forces of the Magical Soldiers. They’re given high quality Zenith equipment purchased from Magical Girls, and are quite powerful” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch34">ch.34.</a></p>
<p><br>“Wardens are equipped with enough enchanted magitech gear that I would bet on them being able to defeat any Guardian lower than level 150. I have no doubt some of the stronger Wardens like Sanguine here would beat any Guardian level 199 and lower.” Ever <a href="/redirects/ch35">ch.35.</a></p>
<p><br>“Magical Soldiers are given Zenith bought equipment, mostly guns and such, but us Wardens, as you may have noticed, have all kinds of toys from dimensional storage items to enchanted power armor and third tier weapons. I even have a personal shield generator of my own. In all, I’m easily equipped with over 300,000 points of equipment, not including the cost you Girls have to pay unlocking those Vaults. I probably also have over 50,000 points of expendable items alone like grenades, first aid, and ammunition.” Sgt Kelly ch.35</p>
