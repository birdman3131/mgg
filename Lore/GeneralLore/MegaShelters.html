<p>These <a href="/Lore/GeneralLore/Shelters">Shelters</a> are built with easy access from the street, as they are expected to not only house residents of whatever building they were in but also people who came in from outside. These shelters also have dedicated professional personnel including security and medical staff. Guard duty is drawn from multiple police precincts.</p>
<p><br>“These shelters have three basic wings. The left one is for administrative and essential services. The middle one is the ‘residential’ with various sleeping rooms, common areas, washrooms and such. The one on the right is storage, maintenance, and all the other things that don’t really fit with the first two.” Ji-woo ch.12.</p>
<p><br>Other things of note:</p>
<p><br>They contain a command room that can access information on the current state of shelters in the same building.</p>
<p><br>Are built with a direct coms line to guardian command.</p>
