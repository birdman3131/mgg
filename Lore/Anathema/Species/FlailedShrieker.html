<p><br>Type: Sentry. Calls other Anathema to its location. It’s scream carries a form of mental impression that transmits it’s exact location to any Anathema that hear it. Scream also functions as an auditory attack.</p>
<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“Its body was nothing more than a ribcage and spine made of black bone, tumorous organs pulsing between the gaps in its ribs. It stood on its elongated spine, like some kind of cobra, and dozens of tiny fingers extended from the spine like centipede legs. It had no arms, just a skull-shaped head with two bulging eyes.” Mai ch.24</p>
