<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“about the size of a small wolf and borrowed the same shape, but instead of fur, it had a slick black carapace covering it in armor, sinewy red muscle poking out between the plates. The thing’s tail was serrated and hung limply behind it at nearly twice the length of its body. As the thing stepped forth, it turned to me. I blinked as my gaze met what looked almost like a giant eel’s head. It’s unassuming, derpy eyes stared back, lidless and unmoving.</p>
<p>Then it opened its mouth, and I realized its head wasn’t that of an eel but a lamprey.” Mai ch.2</p>

<p>“Fomorian Hounds consume their victims in a way similar to how lampreys eat. Using the suction cup of their mouth and teeth, they dig into the flesh. Then they use their serrated knife-tongue to rasp away any protective layers before they puncture and gouge into their victim. Whirling their tongue around, they mulch the flesh within the wound to be easily sucked up” Selene ch.4</p>
