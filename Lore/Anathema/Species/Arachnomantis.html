<p>First seen:<a href="/redirects/ch18"> ch.18</a></p>
<p><br>First mentioned <a href="/redirects/ch1">ch.1</a> as the third floor dungeon boss in the game MGSR.</p>
<p><br>Level range: Newborn Arachnomantis: 21-25. &nbsp;Other varieties not known.</p>
<p><br>Point value: 50</p>
<p><br>Melee type primarily using its scythes. Can move fast in a straight charge but relatively slow at turning. Can make and shoot webs.</p>
<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“The Arachnomantis was mostly half spider and half mantis, but there were human features mixed in that gave it a twisted edge. The lower half of its body was like a giant spider but covered in dark, chitinous plating. Each of its eight legs tapered off into blades that clicked against the tiled floor with each movement. Where the spider’s head should have been was where the “mantis” portion began, a torso sticking upward in a centaur-like fashion.</p>
<p>The torso itself was more human looking, petite with gentle, feminine curves. It was covered in more black chitin that stuck closely to its figure, accentuating its too-thin, alien form. The arms themselves looked like that of a mantis, double jointed and ending in wicked, serrated scythes of gray metal. Finally, the Anathema’s head was human shaped, but had the fanged mouth and eight eyes of a spider. The gleaming black orbs reflected glints of red light, almost like eldritch pupils searching for prey.” Mai ch.18</p>
