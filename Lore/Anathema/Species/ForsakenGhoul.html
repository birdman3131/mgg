<p><br>Description:</p>
<p>“vaguely humanoid but crouched over on all fours with a bent back. Covered in slick black skin that blended them with the darkness, and large hands with thick claws made of bone. The creature stood oddly still compared to the hounds, only giving an occasional shudder at seemingly random intervals.” Mai ch.9.</p>
<p>“Emaciated with off-black skin stretched over pointed bones, and an otherwise featureless head was dominated by a wide mouth with pointed, pale white teeth as long as a finger. They move on all fours in an odd, jittery gait” Mai. <a href="/redirects/ch10">ch.10</a></p>
