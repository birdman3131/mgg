<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“It was about five feet tall and vaguely ape like, but its mouthless head was sunken into its chest. Every inch of its body was rippling black muscle, and its yellow on black eyes burned as it lumbered towards me. It moved on all fours, its massive arms helping to propel itself forward.” Mai ch.24</p>
