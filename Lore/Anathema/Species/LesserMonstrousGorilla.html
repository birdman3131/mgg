<p><br>Description:</p>
<p>“The thing was big. Big enough that I had no idea how I hadn’t seen it before. It was seven feet tall on all fours with big, tree-trunk arms thicker than my entire body. Its entire body was covered in dark scales, and had a vaguely reptilian face with three bulging eyes independently looking around. Covering the monster’s back were dozens of forearm-length tentacles. Its arms ended in stumps, making them more like giant clubs than anything else.” Mai ch.10</p>
