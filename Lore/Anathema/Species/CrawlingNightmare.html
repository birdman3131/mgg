<p>First Seen: ch.24</p>
<p><br>Level Range: ?? Seen lvl 24</p>
<p><br>Point Value: 50</p>
<p><br>Type: ?</p>
<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“The creature was huge, nearly three feet thick even lying flat against the ground. It was little more than a torso with arms, and a trailing spinal cord acting as some sort of tail.” Mai ch .24</p>
<p>“Large fingers, each as thick as were made of the same slick black flesh of the other Anathema I’d seen, and the worn and chipped nails were as pale as bone. The hands were so big, one had to grab through the opening above the other, each large enough to fill the gap on their own.” Mai ch.24</p>
<p>The humanoid face was low to the ground, as if the creature was lying prone or else crawling. The black flesh of its face was peeled back as if it had no skin, giving it an eternally smiling grin of white, pointed teeth. Four giant eyes stared at me.” Mai ch.24</p>
