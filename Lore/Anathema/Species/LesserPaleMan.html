<p><br>Used for psychological warfare, they have the ability to imitate human vocal noises such as, childlike giggling. They are also capable of limited speech.</p>
<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“The thing was tall, so much so that it was hunched over in the hallway. It looked vaguely humanoid, but as if it was poorly shaped from pale, featureless clay. Its arms were long enough to touch the ground, and its fingers were jointless, undulating things. The monster was horribly emaciated, so much that its ribs were practically poking through its chest. The worst part, though, was the face. It had no eyes, only big, empty sockets. Below, was a giant, lipless mouth that took up a full third of its head, and it was stretched into a mocking grin wide enough to show its gums. The monster’s teeth were perfect human teeth, but upscaled to fit its gaping maw.” Lily ch.7</p>
