<p><br>Stalker type, stealthy, ambush predator. They usually find a hiding spot typically on ceilings, and will stay there waiting for prey.</p>
<p><br>Appearance:</p>
<p>“A mass of black vines knotted together, like some kind of monstrous plant mass stuck to the ceiling. It had shark-like teeth lining its tendrils, like some kind of demented thorns. Worse, in the center of the knotted mass was a giant bloodshot eyeball, quivering uncontrollably as if it was screaming.“ Mai ch.19</p>
