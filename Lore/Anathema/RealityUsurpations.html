<p>When anathema create rifts in space to come to earth it destabilizes the Reality of an area, this area is called a Usurpation zone.</p>
<p>“Usurpation Zones are bubbles of miasma, and the more Anathema in the area or the stronger they are, the more miasma there is. It has the side effect of interfering with things such as long-distance magic.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch23">ch.23</a></p>
<p><br>All Usurpations have a Curse Seed that functions as its core and destabilizes the Reality in the area. Destruction of the Curse seed will end that specific Usurpation and keep anathema from coming to earth as well as weaken any in the Zone.</p>
<p>Most anathema will eventually die on their own outside of Usurpations. &nbsp;Unfortunately, most does not mean all.</p>
<p><br>The size of the Usurpation and Miasma density indicate the approximate level and or number of Anathema that will be found within.</p>
<p>It is possible to have anything from a small house sized usurpation with very high Miasma density, and only a single very strong Anathema, to a large Usurpation with low Miasma density and a large number of low level Anathema.</p>
<p>Both examples would take the Anathema the same amount of resources to create, but are vastly different in the required strength, and resources required for humans to close them.</p>
<p><br><u>Curse seeds in weaker Usurpations appear as:</u></p>
<p>“a stationary object that looks like a glowing, semi-crystalline flower.” Ever <a href="/redirects/ch35">ch.35</a></p>
<p>“A giant flower that was almost identical to a red spider lily, although its petals were a glowing violet color while the stem was an inky black. From the center of the flower, fractal lines of black shadow arced out into reality, splitting the air as if it was made of glass.” Mai ch.35</p>
<p>In stronger ones curse seeds may fuse with an Anathema creating a Seed Bearer. &nbsp;A Seed Bearer is much stronger than a normal anathema of its type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Usurpations are called "Rebellions".<br><br>“Rebellions are much more dangerous than a normal Usurpation. Instead of opening a rift from their side, the Anathema create one from this reality. It lets them bring in stronger forces from the beginning, and with a nest, they already have a base of operations to form more Anathema” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch16">ch.16</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usurpation Zones we know the names of:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;UZ 15-01: &nbsp;The UZ that Mai is in.<br>U19-01: &nbsp;The one that <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Teams/FantasyFatale">Fantasy Fatale</a> cleared.</p>
