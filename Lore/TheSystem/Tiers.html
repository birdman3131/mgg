<p>MGs are assigned to ‘tiers' based on their level. &nbsp;Levels 1-99 are tier 1, 100-199 tier 2, 200-299 tier 3, 300-399 tier 4, 400-499 tier 5, 500-599 tier 6. &nbsp;(No MGs are currently over 599, although there is no hard limit.)</p>
<p><a href="/Lore/TheSystem/GrimoiresVaults">Vaults, Grimoires</a>, Items, and <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Spells">Spells</a> also have tiers. &nbsp;An MG can only buy things of their tier or lower. &nbsp;For example, Naiad, at tier 2, just under 200, can only by tier 1 and 2 spells, not tier 3. &nbsp;Mai, and all other MGs less than level 100 can only but tier 1 (Common) items. &nbsp;This would seem to be the main reason that multiples of 100 are major milestone levels.</p>
<p>For “nonesoteric” items, the tiers are named: Common, Rare, Masterwork, Arcane, Legendary, Mythic. Selene <a href="https://mggwiki.arthrift.com/redirects/ch5">ch.5</a></p>
