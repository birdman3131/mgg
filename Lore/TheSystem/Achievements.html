<p>“Achievements (as in the proper noun) themselves don't play a part in unlocking Skills, achievements (as in what you achieve) determine what Classes you unlock, which also determine Skills.” Mikasane, Discord #mgg-general<i>&nbsp; </i>9/7/2023 11:17 PM</p>
<p><br>“There's kind of a tier list for achievements, so you can get both lower tier ones like "Broken Wings" that give flat vitality, and you could get the higher tier version "Seraph's Shield" which would be like the halo and scale.” Mikasane, Discord #mgg-general<i> </i>9/7/2023 11:24 PM</p>
