<p>“Signature” or “Signature Magic” refers to your entirely unique magical ability. All Guardians have one, but no two are the same due to no two individuals being the same. While your Signature Magic is still technically magic, it is not something that will ever be truly replicated in a Grimoire. Signatures are incredibly powerful and capable of almost anything from actually stopping time to temporary invincibility. They do not function by the normal rules or limits of magic.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch5">ch.5</a></p>
<p><a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Darks">Darks</a> get ones that are stronger then normal and are synergized with their other Origin bonuses</p>
<p><a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Yellow">Yellows</a> get ones that are very unique and capable of breaking what should be possible with magic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All signature magics have a true name, which very few people know, and a code name, which is common knowledge.</p>
<p>An extensive explanation of signature magics is given in <a href="/redirects/ch36">ch. 36</a>.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Notable examples:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/Characters/Mai">Mai:</a></p>
<p>True name: &nbsp;<strong>Kodoku,&nbsp;</strong> aka <i>こどく.</i></p>
<p>Code name: not yet picked (as of ch. 37)</p>
<p>The hiragana is significant, allowing the word ‘kodoku’ to be a homonym with two different meanings:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Kodoku […] can mean loneliness, solitude, or isolation. […] Kodoku is also a name for a type of poisonous magic found in Japanese folklore.” &nbsp;(Bookbear, <a href="/redirects/ch37">ch. 37</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodoku">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodoku</a></p>
<p>There is a long exposition by <a href="/Characters/Bookbear">Bookbear</a> about Mai's signature in ch.37. &nbsp;Summarizing, it gives Mai a miasma resource (negative mana) at the cost of her health. &nbsp;This gives her curse magic, which is effective at destroying normal magic, &nbsp; Applied to bullets. it increases penetration, does damage over time if the bullet stays in the target, and makes regeneration of any wounds harder. &nbsp;For more details, see ch. 37.</p>
