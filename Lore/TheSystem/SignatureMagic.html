<p>“Signature” or “Signature Magic” refers to your entirely unique magical ability. All Guardians have one, but no two are the same due to no two individuals being the same. While your Signature Magic is still technically magic, it is not something that will ever be truly replicated in a Grimoire. Signatures are incredibly powerful and capable of almost anything from actually stopping time to temporary invincibility. They do not function by the normal rules or limits of magic.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch5">ch.5</a></p>
<p>Darks get ones that are stronger then normal and are synergized with their other Origin bonuses</p>
<p>Yellows get ones that are very unique and capable of breaking what should be possible with magic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Notable examples:</u></strong></p>
<p><br><u>Everglaive:</u></p>
<p>Glade of Glaives</p>
<p>Cost: about 1700 mana.</p>
<p>Protects an area by surrounding it with metallic pine trees that are made out of glaives. The needle glaives can be fired at range while, the limb and root glaives can slash and stab.</p>
<p><br><u>Silver Saintess:</u></p>
<p>(former alias Radiant Blade) known as the second strongest MG (heavily debated as to if she should be first), and only known MG to change Origin (from yellow to white meaning she still has the yellow benefits.) has the Signature "Checkpoint." After designating a set location, if she dies, she can revive at the location so long as she has enough mana. (This info has not been shown in the story but was shared in Discord by Mikasane)</p>
