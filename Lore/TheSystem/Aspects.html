<p>“If Origin is the reason a person became a Magical Girl, the Aspect is meant to express what part of that Origin they express. For example, Red Magical Girls have the Origin of Adventure, so their Aspect might be Speed, Fighting, Exploration, or some other Aspect that could be associated with that emotion.Your Aspect also gives you a unique bonus at certain milestone levels.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch21">ch.21</a></p>
<p><br>“Because Dark Magical Girls have an Origin that is a theme of various emotions, your Aspect is instead the exact emotion that best represents your… darkness.” Selene ch.21</p>

<p>We currently don’t have much information in book on aspect bonuses beyond that Mai‘s augment is from her aspect and that is not a common thing to get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mika gave the following information about aspects on discord, 7/23/2024, 10:53 PM:</p>
<p>Aspect Bonuses: What would a Non-Dark MG's look like? Well, let me copy and paste directly from my notes:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Very Generalized Aspect Bonus Distribution for Non-Dark MGS</strong></p>
<p>Level 1: Specific Spell Type Bonus (Conjuration, Single Target, Aoe, Healing, etc.)<br>Level 10: Bonus Experience for Specific Actions (Scouting, Smithing, Healing, Singing, etc.)<br>Level 25: Specific Spell Elemental Bonus Level 50: Bonus Mana Efficiency for Specific Actions<br>Level 100: Specific Weapon Specialization (Stronger, Piercing, Easier to Wield, etc.)<br>Level 250: Bonus Spell Power for Specific Actions<br>Level 500: (HIDDEN)</p>
<p>Generally percentage increases are ~10% NOTE: This is not a golden rule, it is a general one that I use for side-characters. MGs can deviate quite a bit from this rule, even non-Darks. Dark's almost always do, and I'm thinking they usually if not always get a special passive Skill (Augment) like Mai did.</p>
<p>As you can see by the generalized Aspect Bonuses, they are very much more spread out to give the Guardian nice little boosts to a lot of different things. A Dark's Aspect Bonus generally revolves around one singular theme. For Mai it is vision and sin. For another it could be cutting things, breaking things apart, being unseen, etc.</p>
