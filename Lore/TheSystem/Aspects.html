<p>“If Origin is the reason a person became a Magical Girl, the Aspect is meant to express what part of that Origin they express. For example, Red Magical Girls have the Origin of Adventure, so their Aspect might be Speed, Fighting, Exploration, or some other Aspect that could be associated with that emotion. your Aspect also gives you a unique bonus at certain milestone levels.” Selene ch.21</p>
<p><br>“Because Dark Magical Girls have an Origin that is a theme of various emotions, your Aspect is instead the exact emotion that best represents your… darkness.” Selene ch.21</p>

<p>We currently don’t have much information on aspect bonuses beyond that Mai‘s augment is from her aspect and that is not a common thing to get.&nbsp;</p>
