<p>“Origins, as the name might suggest, are the reason one was chosen to be a Magical Girl. There are many specific circumstances, but they are divided into seven basic “emotions” or “themes” that the Magical Girl is said to be a representation of. Each of these Origins is also given a color that the Magical Girl is obligated to use as the primary color in their outfit. Magically speaking, your Origin determines what is called your Origin or color type bonus. These bonuses are extremely powerful, and could be compared to the racial bonuses of a video game. Because of this, it usually helps determine the combat role they take.”</p>
