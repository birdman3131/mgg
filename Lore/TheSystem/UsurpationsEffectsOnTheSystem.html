<p>“Usurpation zones cutting off most communication, active contact with the System can not be maintained. Excluding major milestones or events such as your contract ceremony, you are cut off from receiving System updates such as quests”</p>
<p><br>“when you summon things with the <a href="/Lore/ArcaneGate">Arcane Gate</a>, you actually use some of your mana to send the ‘message’ of what you need. For lower tier items, it doesn’t amount to much more than one or two mana per summon, but some of the more advanced technology or more expensive items can take a healthy chunk. Basically, the mana you spend is used for punching a hole through the Usurpation zone to get the item sent to you.” Error <a href="/redirects/ch16">ch.16</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wireless communication with individuals that are inside a Usurpation requires the use of specialized equipment that utilizes mana.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>Usurpations also affect the abilities of long rang support MG that are outside the usurpation and trying to cast into it. The higher the miasma concentration the harder it will be to cast into it from outside, a strong enough MG can still use their abilities though with diminishing affects depending on their strength.</p>
