<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Alignment:</strong></span></p>
<p><br><strong><u>Strength:</u></strong></p>
<p>Example. “a strength-aligned sword would make it grow sharper, sturdier, and heavier to offset your strength bonus. It would essentially always feel the same weight to you, but in reality, it would be heavier and therefore more potent as you swung it at opponents” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch6">ch.6</a></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Dexterity:</u></strong></p>
<p>Example. “for a bow and arrow. Faster and stronger projectiles with more kinetic power. The weapon itself would also gain some benefits to durability.” Selene ch.6</p>
