<p>“A oath on a soul gem is the most binding oath a Guardian can give without signing a direct Geas. If he were to break his word, he would lose points and a massive amount of experience, most likely resulting in the loss of multiple levels. A portion of that penalty would be transferred to you along with a notification he had broken his word” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch16">ch.16</a> (talking about Error.)</p>
