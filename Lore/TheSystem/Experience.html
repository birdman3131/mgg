<p>“The main source of experience is defeating <a href="/Lore/Anathema/">Anathema</a>, The higher the Anathema’s level, the more experience you earn. Every time you level up, the experience needed to get to the next level increases. Moreover, there are certain “milestone levels” where the amount of experience required increases by a dramatic amount. Levels ten, twenty-five, fifty, and 250 are considered minor milestones, while every hundredth level is a major one. The only other functional thing you need to know is you get less experience for defeating Anathema lower than your level, but it only really becomes a significant reduction when there is a level difference of fifteen or more. Of course, the reverse is also true” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch27">ch.27</a></p>
<p><br>Experience for kills goes to any MG who helped based on contribution. Points only go to the MG who actually killed it (got the last hit) unless the participants are in a party.</p>
