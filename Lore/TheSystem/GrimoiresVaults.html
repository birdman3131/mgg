<p>Grimoires and Vaults are catalogs of spells and items. &nbsp;They are collectively known as “Permissions”.</p>
<p>A correction from Mika, 8/25/2024 6:27 pm, mgg-general:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I made an oopsie on Chapter 5. First, I forgot to explain that Vault/Grimoire rarities are locked behind major milestones (every hundredth level). So at level 1-99, Guardians only can buy tier one (aka common rarity) things. At 100 they unlock the next tier, 200 the one after that, and etc. Secondly, I also had more tiers/rarities shown than there should have been. Seeing as the highest level Guardians are only in the 500s, there should only be six known rarities. That has been fixed, so the current rarities are now Common, Rare, Masterwork, Arcane, Legendary, Mythic.</p>

<p>Here is what was originally posted:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>[The Grimoire and Vault section shows what you have spent points to gain access to. Grimoires and Vaults can be viewed as “catalogs” for magical spells and physical items respectively. You must unlock them to first buy the items they contain, just as you did with the First Aid Vault (Common). The (Common) tag indicates its rarity as the first of eight tiers, each tier providing a selection of better items or spells but also costing more.]</i></p>
  <p><i>[Common is first, then Rare, Masterwork, Arcane, Legendary, Mythic, Ascendant, and finally Divine. There is also a second set of tags used for more… esoteric items. The Arcane System, while useful, also has some oddities. Magic is not something that can be entirely codified or neatly labeled, and as such, the System sometimes does surprising things in its translations. The esoteric rarities are used to help label such idiosyncrasies.] &nbsp;</i>Selene, <a href="/redirects/ch5">ch.5</a></p>

<p>Thus normally one first buys access to a grimoire or a vault, and then buys spells or items from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An exception is that all <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Darks">Darks</a> have a special unique grimoire that is tailored to their <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/SignatureMagic">signature</a> and <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Aspects">aspect</a>. &nbsp;(<a href="/redirects/ch21">ch.21</a>) Unfortunately, Mai's is currently thoroughly glitched. &nbsp;This is because of her “<i>Unawakened Signature” &nbsp;(</i><a href="/redirects/ch32">ch.32</a>), so should be fixed when she awakens her signature. &nbsp;Whether this is true for all new Darks is unknown. &nbsp;Note that just having this or any other grimoire or vault does nothing for the owner; you have to spend <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Points">points</a> to buy something that it is in it for it to have any effect.</p>
<p>List of vaults readers know about is <a href="/Lore/ArcaneGate/Vaults">here</a>. &nbsp;Currently we do not know any grimoires, aside from Mai's glitched one. &nbsp;tutpuppy figured out what Mai's grimoire currently says (comments, RR chapter 16). &nbsp;It reads “Error: unable to access” in a strange font, overwritten by strange symbols in a stranger font.<br>&nbsp;</p>
