<p>Mai's starting stats (all tens except Willpower 30 and Spirit 1) are standard for all MGs, not special to Mai. &nbsp;Mika, discord, #patreon-discussion, 9-12-2024 10:04 PM.</p>
<p>Statistics represent the boost when Astral Shift is being used.<br><br>When Astral Shift is inactive only 10% of Statistics apply.</p>
<p>“Health and Mana (as seen on the status sheet) track the overall healthiness of your body and your magical energy” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch5">ch.5</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What the individual stats control and affect:</h1>
<p><br><strong><u>Strength:</u></strong></p>
<p>determines your physical strength and damage with strength aligned items. Large increase to vertical jump height (warning using high strength to jump may cause structural damage)</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Dexterity:</u></strong></p>
<p>determines your finesse with various things, how well you move, how graceful you are, and your damage with Dexterity aligned items. Your speed slightly increases as well as you become more proficient in moving the most effective way possible.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Vitality:</u></strong></p>
<p>how much health you have, how sturdy you are, and your physical resistances. Also gives your aura better defense against physical attacks.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Agility:</u></strong></p>
<p>determines how quickly you move and your reaction time. Large increase to horizontal jump distance. Also increases vertical jump distance but less then strength. (High agility jumping doesn’t have the collateral damage problem). Has a significant effect on stamina, unknown if it is on stamina amount or stamina consumption.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Willpower:</u></strong></p>
<p>determines the raw power of your spells, your resistance to hostile magic, and the size of your mana pool. Every point in Willpower adds 10 maximum mana. Willpower also determines the overall capacity of your aura.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Spirit:</u></strong></p>
<p>determines your finesse over spells, meaning how quickly you can cast them, how much you can modify or aim them, how well they penetrate through magic resistance, and your mana regeneration rate. Every point in Spirit adds 5 mana regen per minute. Also gives your aura better defense against magical attacks, also determines how quickly aura regenerates.</p>

<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Current questions (as of </strong></span><a href="/redirects/ch35"><span class="text-big"><strong>ch.35</strong></span></a><span class="text-big"><strong>):</strong></span></p>
<p><br>In ch.35 Mai noted a significant change in her stamina. At the time she has 70 Agi and Dex, with relatively minimal increases in her other stats. It is unknown which stat or combination of the two is the cause. Also unknown if the stats are affecting her total stamina, the rate she consumes stamina, or a combination of the two.</p>
