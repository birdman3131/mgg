<p>“When you activate your Astral Shift, any clothing you are currently wearing will turn into mana and be stored while your own mana weaves together your outfit. As such, you will be selecting everything you want to wear in your Magical Girl form from undergarments to accessories. Some items you buy from the Gate can also be “attached” to your Astral Shift, essentially storing them and then being retrieved with your transformation.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch32">ch.32</a></p>
<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Gives:</strong></span></p>
<p><br>Costume aka Astral Dress, that can or redesigned once per day.</p>
<p><br>The ability to change your physical appearance ie. ears, hair, skin, etc. as well as add things like cat ears or tails etc.</p>
<p>Eyes can not be changed.</p>
<p><br>Access to the full benefits of <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Stats">stats</a>. (Beyond the&nbsp; 10% when not shifted)</p>
<p><br>A shield referred to as an <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Aura">Astral Barrier</a> that blocks damage over what your stats allow you to tank without damage, only up to a certain amount of damage based on your stats. &nbsp;A very strong or piercing attack can penetrate one's Barrier. (Pre-edits, this was known as Aura.)</p>
<p><br>A highly advanced identity protection enchantment that “affects the part of the brain that recognizes faces for anybody who looks at you. While you may not look any different from your normal self, the magic tricks people into associating your appearance with a completely separate identity. It works through pictures and video, and is potent enough that even if somebody had an image of you in both forms and compared them, they would still think that the pictures didn’t match.” Ever <a href="/redirects/ch29">ch.29</a></p>
<p>(Not infallible as people can still realize you disappear every time a MG shows up).</p>
<p><br>“Astral Dresses, can be enchanted with several effects. It doesn’t require a Vault, and you can get several useful utility effects such as water wicking and thermal regulation.” Ever <a href="/redirects/ch31">ch.31</a></p>
<p><br>Modesty protection aka ‘Magic skirt’. “Any skirt you wear will refuse to fully obey the laws of physics, always working to provide modesty from any visual observer.” Ever ch.31 (Can be turned off if you are over 18).</p>
<p>When one casts an Astral Shift, it takes some time to activate; &nbsp;while this is happening, the MG is basically paralyzed, but is invulnerable. &nbsp; &nbsp;If one recasts the Astral Shift before it expires, this costs as much as the initial cast, replenishes the Barrier to its original strength, and extends the duration by another hour. &nbsp;Recasting is very fast, but does not provide the invulnerability of the initial cast. &nbsp;(<a href="/redirects/ch36">ch. 36</a>)</p>
