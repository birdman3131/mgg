<p>“When you activate your Astral Shift, any clothing you are currently wearing will turn into mana and be stored while your own mana weaves together your outfit. As such, you will be selecting everything you want to wear in your Magical Girl form from undergarments to accessories. Some items you buy from the Gate can also be “attached” to your Astral Shift, essentially storing them and then being retrieved with your transformation.” Selene ch.32</p>
