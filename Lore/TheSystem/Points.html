<p>Points are the currency for MGs.</p>
<p>Mika has posted a spreadsheet with a lot of information about points: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GTiU6b0y6JNqLx4CiWHjicfn6iGGLNBoqnt6IzhdCIg/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Points Madness</a>.</p>
<p>They are gotten by killing <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Quests">quests</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/Lore/Anathema">anathema</a>, and saving people. &nbsp;Only the person who makes the killing blow gets points for killing anathema, unless they are in a party. &nbsp;If they are in a party, points are shared among party members; &nbsp;I assume evenly.</p>
<p>The points one gets from killing anathema depend only on the type of anathema – its level and the MG's level do not affect how many points you get.</p>
<p>The points one gets from quests is affected by your level: [<i>Every hundredth level you achieve will increase the amount of possible points that can be rewarded to you through quests.] </i>Selene, <a href="/redirects/ch30">ch. 30</a></p>
<p>Points can be spent on <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/GrimoiresVaults">Permissions</a> (Vaults and Grimoires) and <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/AbilitiesAndAugments">Skills</a>. &nbsp;Skills must be unlocked before they can be bought; Common permissions just take points. Higher tier permissions may be bought once one reaches the appropriate level – every hundred levels opens a new tier. &nbsp; Once a permission has been bought, an MG can buy items from vaults, using the <a href="/Lore/ArcaneGate">Arcane Gate</a> system, and spells from grimoires.</p>
