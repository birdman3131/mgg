<p>Points are the currency for MGs.</p>
<p>They are gotten by killing <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Quests">quests</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/Lore/Anathema">anathema</a>, and saving people. &nbsp;Only the person who makes the killing blow gets points for killing anathema, unless they are in a party. &nbsp;If they are in a party, points are shared among party members; &nbsp;I assume evenly.</p>
<p>The points one gets from killing anathema depend only on the type of anathema – its level and the MG's level do not affect how many points you get.</p>
<p>The points one gets from quests is affected by your level – the higher your level, the more points you get for a given quest.</p>
<p>They can be spent on <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/GrimoiresVaults">Permissions</a> (Vaults and Grimoires) and <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/AbilitiesAndAugments">Skills</a>. &nbsp;Skills must be unlocked before they can be bought; &nbsp;Permissions just take points. &nbsp;Once a permission has been bought, an MG can buy items from vaults, using the<a href="/Lore/ArcaneGate/Points"> Arcane Gate</a> system, and spells from grimoires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
