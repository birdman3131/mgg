<p>"The Arcane System sometimes awards tasks called “quests” for Guardians to complete. These tasks can range from taking down an Usurpation Zone to helping a child find their lost dog. Any task that helps to protect or restore hope to humanity is eligible to be a quest, however, know that the System does not make everything into a quest. There is much debate as to how the System decides what should and shouldn’t be one, but that is a topic for another time. What you need to know now is that quests are always given an estimated difficulty which represents the System’s estimation of the danger or complexity of the task at the time the quest is offered. This difficulty level is not concrete, as circumstances can always change. The System can’t read what might happen in the future, after all."<i> &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Selene <a href="/redirects/ch27">ch.27</a></p>
<p>Quests do not award experience, only points.</p>
<p>The point value of a quest is based on the level of the person completing the quest – higher level gets more points – and the importance of a quest, not its difficulty.</p>
<p>Difficulty levels seen: &nbsp;Very Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, Death Wish.</p>
<p>Easy almost certainly exists, but we haven't seen an Easy quest yet.</p>
<p>There is no penalty for failing a quest, except for not getting the reward.</p>
<p>All MGs are offered “daily, weekly, and monthly” quests. &nbsp; We do not know exactly what these are or what their rewards are.</p>
