<p><br><strong><u>Origin:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“those who have experienced such darkness in their lives that the Anathema are pale in comparison. Whether it be pain, despair, sadness, or a myriad of other emotions.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch21">ch.21</a></p>
<p><br><strong><u>Bonus:</u></strong></p>
<p>Completely unique Grimoire.</p>
<p>Significantly more powerful Signature Magic typically with a dark spin.</p>
<p>“Grimoire, Signature, and the bonus provided by their Aspect are all linked together by some underlying theme and power, giving a Dark Magical Girl a naturally synergistic set of abilities that are not only powerful, but completely unique and therefore unpredictable.” Selene ch.21</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Combat role:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Duelist. Boss killers.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Emotion/motivation:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Dark Magical Girls have no one unifying emotion, just a theme.” Selene ch.21</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Theme:</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suffering.</p>
<p>“Dark Magical Girls have experienced suffering, and in that suffering, have survived. They are chosen not because they wanted to escape their circumstances, but because they instead learned to live despite the shadows.”</p>
<p><br><strong><u>General:</u></strong></p>
<p>Make up 3% of MG</p>
<p>“Personalities run a full gambit, but other Magical Girls often categorize them as antisocial, quiet, loners, and unstable.” Selene ch.21 more on <a href="/Lore/MGLore/HowDarksArePerceived">How Darks are Perceived</a></p>
<p>“Every Dark Magical Girl is chosen partially because even though they faced horrors, they had no particular desire to become a Magical Girl until it was offered. This is mostly due to the fact that Dark Magical Girls never even realized it was an option, thinking themselves… unworthy. The truth, however, is that their experiences make them uniquely capable to stare down the worst of the Anathema and fight without faltering. That is why they are chosen.” Selene ch.21</p>
