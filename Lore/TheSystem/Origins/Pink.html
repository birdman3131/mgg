<p>“Pinks often end up becoming team leaders simply due to the stat and point differences. They also tend to be people with natural charisma, being friendly and compassionate as one would expect from a Magical Girl who represents love. They are, essentially, the ideal example of a Magical Girl.” Selene ch.21</p>
