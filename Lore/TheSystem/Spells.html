<p>Through the use of soul gems MG can use magic in the form of premade Spells that can be purchased with points once the necessary Grimoires have been unlocked.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willpower affects the power of spells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spirit determines your finesse over spells, meaning how quickly you can cast them, how much you can modify or aim them, how well they penetrate through magic resistance.</p>
<p>Spells are in tiers: &nbsp;tier 1 = levels 1-100, tier 2 = 101-200, tier 3 = 201 to presumably 300, although we have not seen anybody capable of using anything higher than tier three yet. &nbsp;However, it seems reasonable that tiers continue to increase.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Spell slots:</strong></span></p>
<p>aka how many spells you can have prepared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Spells are soft capped. You can buy and know as many as you want, but you can only have so many prepared a day.</p>
<p>You current level = current spell cap, BUT spells in higher tiers require higher tier spell slots. For instance, at level 101 and beyond you earn tier two slots instead of tier one. A tier two slot can also be exchanged to learn two tier one spells.</p>
<p>And classes/Skills can increase your spell cap.” Mikasane Discord</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Finale-class Spells:</strong></span></p>
<p>At level 200, an MG either gets or gets access to a Finale-class spell. &nbsp;This is an especially powerful spell, and seems to be tailored to the MGs theme, maybe even to their <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/SignatureMagic">signature</a>.</p>
