<p>Through the use of soul gems MG can use magic in the form of premade Spells that can be purchased with points once the nesce Grimoirs have been unlocked.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willpower affects the power of spells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spirit determines your finesse over spells, meaning how quickly you can cast them, how much you can modify or aim them, how well they penetrate through magic resistance.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Spell slots:</strong></span></p>
<p>aka how many spells you can have prepared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Spells are soft capped. You can buy and know as many as you want, but you can only have so many prepared a day.</p>
<p>You current level = current spell cap, BUT spells in higher tiers require higher tier spell slots. For instance, at level 101 and beyond you earn tier two slots instead of tier one. A tier two slot can also be exchanged to learn two tier one spells.</p>
<p>And classes/Skills can increase your spell cap.” Mikasane Discord</p>
