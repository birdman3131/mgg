<p>Levels are a measure of strength for both MGs and <a href="/Lore/Anathema/">anathema</a>. &nbsp;MGs get levels by gaining <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Experience">experience</a>. &nbsp;It is not known if anathema gain levels, or are simply created with the level they appear at.</p>
<p>Each level gives an MG ten <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Stats">stat</a> points, to be distributed as they see fit.</p>
<p>"Levels ten, twenty-five, fifty, and 250 are considered minor milestones, while every hundredth level is a major one" &nbsp;Selene <a href="/redirects/ch27">ch.27</a></p>
<p><a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Classes">Classes</a> also have their own levels, although we know very little about how they gain levels. &nbsp;The only thing we know is that Cutie Pie's class, <strong>Pastry Princess, </strong>leveled up multiple times after the <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Levels">seed bearer</a> was defeated. &nbsp;Her class was about ten levels lower than her level. &nbsp;(<a href="/redirects/ch25">Ch. 25</a>) &nbsp;A starting class gives on average one stat point per level, plus a one time start bonus (15 stat points in the case we know about).</p>
<p>A typical MG is somewhere between level 35-65 at the end of their first year, although a few will make it over level 100. &nbsp;(Mika, discord, 03/30/2024 4:00 PM)</p>
