<p>Levels are a measure of strength for both MGs and <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Levels">anathema</a>. &nbsp;MGs get levels by gaining <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Experience">experience</a>. &nbsp;It is not known if anathema gain levels, or are simply created with the level they appear at.</p>
<p>Each level gives an MG ten <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Stats">stat</a> points, to be distributed as they see fit.</p>
<p>A typical MG is somewhere between level 35-65 at the end of their first year, although a few will make it over level 100. &nbsp;(Mika, discord, 03/30/2024 4:00 PM)</p>
