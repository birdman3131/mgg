<p>“Wait, are you telling me we’re killing eldritch monsters with <i>cuteness</i>?” &nbsp;<a href="/Characters/Mai">Mai</a> to <a href="/Characters/Selene">Selene</a> <a href="/redirects/ch5">ch.5</a></p>
<p><i>[...Yes?] &nbsp;Selene's reply.</i></p>

<p>“Humans are an unattuned race and cannot access magic normally through willpower alone, the Zenith developed an advanced piece of Magitech to give humans access. This device is called a “Soul Gem.” During the contract ceremony, it was teleported into your brain and attached. As a side note, it is also where I now reside” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>“The Soul Gem offers access to two major things: the “<a href="/Lore/ArcaneGate">Gate</a>” you are already familiar with, and the “<a href="/Lore/TheSystem/System101">Arcane System</a>,” or simply “System” for short. A big part of the System is it allows you to simply purchase access to various spells and abilities. Instead of it taking years to learn even the most basic of magics, the knowledge is directly sent and stored into your Soul Gem for use. Instantaneous access and control with none of the work! A good analogy is to imagine a computer: Instead of coding a program entirely from scratch, you are simply downloading a pre-existing program to use.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>The reasoning for leveling and gaining power over time as explained by Selene in ch.5.</p>
<p>“complete access without first adapting to magic would make your head literally explode with magical energy. Soul Gems do not start at their maximum potential for this reason. Instead, they grow with their users by absorbing mana as experience, or simply “Exp.” As Soul Gems grow, your physical abilities increase too. Meanwhile, the point system is designed to restrict what spells you can access, forcing you to earn points by doing tasks that also help your Soul Gem mature. Between the two, your physical and magical abilities remain in check without surpassing your limitations.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>“<a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Experience">Experience</a> and <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Points">points</a> can be earned through a variety of activities, though the biggest source is defeating <a href="/Lore/Anathema/">Anathema</a>. Other things such as System-issued <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Quests">quests</a>, helping civilians, and generally creating happiness also contribute.”</p>
<p><br>Each level gives 10 stat points. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br><a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Stats">“Statistics</a> do not represent your normal physical abilities, but rather how much of a boost you gain after you do your “transformation sequence.” By raising these “Stats,” you will grow stronger.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>“<a href="/Lore/TheSystem/GrimoiresVaults">Grimoires and Vaults</a> can be viewed as “catalogs” for magical spells and physical items respectively. You must unlock them to first buy the items they contain.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>“<a href="/Lore/TheSystem/AbilitiesAndAugments">Abilities and Augments</a>, together commonly referred to as your “Skills.” Slightly different from spells, Abilities do exactly what they prescribe without being able to be modified. They can cost mana to use or have a cooldown period before they can be used again. Augments are the passive or toggleable versions of abilities, constantly being active. Each Augment takes away from your total mana regeneration rate, even when not in use. You can have a total of seven Abilities and seven Augments, but acquiring them is slightly different. They are only unlocked through raising your level, your class level, or the corresponding stat requirements. Many require a combination, and once unlocked, they must also be purchased with points.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>“Abilities and Augments have levels of their own that increase through use. Their max level is limited by either your level, or your class level.” Selene ch.5</p>
<p><br>“<a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Classes">Classes</a> are locked until you reach level 10. Class refers to your combat style, and choosing one gives you bonuses as well as unlocks specialty Grimoires, Vaults, and Skills.”</p>
<p><br>“”<a href="/Lore/TheSystem/SignatureMagic">Signature</a>” or “Signature Magic” refers to your entirely unique magical ability. All Guardians have one, but no two are the same due to no two individuals being the same. While your Signature Magic is still technically magic, it is not something that will ever be truly replicated in a Grimoire. Signatures are incredibly powerful and capable of almost anything from actually stopping time to temporary invincibility. They do not function by the normal rules or limits of magic. It is best to unlock your Signature through the proper facilities and observational tools. Certain Signatures can be hard to figure out or downright dangerous to their owners without knowledge about them.” Selene ch.5</p>
