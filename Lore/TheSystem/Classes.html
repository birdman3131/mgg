<p>Unlock at level 10.</p>
<p>Give access to some <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/AbilitiesAndAugments">skills</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most MG get 7 generic options to choose from. Though rarely extra Unique options will be given. “Unique Classes offer more specific options and will most likely be slightly more powerful than average.” &nbsp;Ever <a href="/redirects/ch31">ch. 31</a></p>
<p>“Achievements (as in what you achieve) determine what Classes you unlock, which also determine Skills.” Mikasane, Discord #mgg-genera<i> </i>9/7/2023 11:17 PM</p>
<p>Mai unlocked 10 classes, although as of ch.37 we don't know what any of them are.</p>
<p>The only class we know any MG has is <a href="/Characters/CutiePie">Cutie Pie's</a> Pastry Princess, level 126. &nbsp;It is a pretty good assumption that this is not one of the starting seven.<br><br>“Unique Classes generally are stronger and offer earlier specialization which allows for earlier refinement.” Mikasane, Discord #mgg-general&nbsp;<i> </i>9/7/2023 11:19 PM</p>
<p>On discord at 7/16/2024 11:20 PM, Mika gave an example of a beginner class:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[+10 Strength, +5 Vitality]<br>[+1 Strength every 2 Class levels.]&nbsp;<br>[+1 Vitality and Agility every 4 Class levels.]<br>[Strength aligned weapons are 5% more powerful.]<br>[Physical Based Magic and Skills are 5% more powerful]&nbsp;<br>[Unlocks unique <i>REDACTED</i> Skills.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus picking this class instantly gives you 1.5 stat points worth of levels, as well as giving access to new skills and a small bonus to weapons, magic, and skills. &nbsp;Also, it gives, on average 1 stat point per class level. &nbsp;Assuming that classes level up at about the same rate as levels (which is the case for Cutie), that is an increase of 10% of stat growth.</p>
<p>On 7/31/2024 Mika put the following on spacebattles. &nbsp;Note that is slightly different from the above:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You get a starting choice of 7 Classes upon reaching main level 10. Unique Classes, which are Classes more specifically designed around a certain theme, can be offered to those who have the Stats, Skill levels, and/or done enough interesting things for the System to acknowledge them with a new Class. Once chosen, a Class starts at level 0 and upgrades/evolves at level 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400. At each of those milestones, a new selection of classes is chosen, some being straight upgrades while others offer different paths. For instance, at level 0 you might choose the Warrior class, but at level 20, you might get choices of Swordsmen, Spearmen, Legionnaire, Axeman, and etc. Each upgrade tends to narrow down the focus of the class while also giving better benefits.<br><br>Leveling your class gives you bonus stat points decided by your class, and this bonus grows every certain amount of levels. For example, the basic Warrior Class gives:<br><br><i>[+15 Strength, +5 Vitality. + 5 Agility]</i><br><i>[+1 Strength every 2 Class levels.]&nbsp;</i><br><i>[+1 Vitality and Agility every 4 Class levels.]</i><br><br>Classes also give other bonuses, some of which are percentage boosts to certain weapon types, magics, or actions.<br><br>Currently, there is no known instance of a Magical Guardian getting a second Class.&nbsp;<br><br>Classes gain experience through defeating Anathema or doing actions that fall in line with the class. (Training with weapons for a Warrior, cooking for a Cook Class, making swords as a Smith, etc.). A class can not be higher level than a MG's main level.<br><br>The max level a Skill (Ability/Augment) can have is determined by the the Class's evolution tier. The first class gives a Skill Level Cap of 5. Second raises to 10, Third to 20, fourth to 40, fifth to 80, and sixth to ??? (highest level MGs are only in the 500 range, so details on that are hard to come by).</p>
