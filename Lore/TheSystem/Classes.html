<p>Most MG get 7 generic options to choose from. Though rarely extra Unique options will be given. “Achievements (as in what you achieve) determine what Classes you unlock.” Mikasane, Discord</p>
<p>Mai managed to unlock 10 classes, although as of ch.35 we don't know what any of them are.<br><br>“Unique Classes generally are stronger and offer earlier specialization which allows for earlier refinement.” Mikasane, Discord</p>
<p>On discord at 7/16/2024 11:20 PM, Mika gave an example of a beginner class:</p>
<p>[+10 Strength, +5 Vitality]<br>&nbsp;[+1 Strength every 2 Class levels.]&nbsp;<br>[+1 Vitality and Agility every 4 Class levels.]<br>&nbsp;[Strength aligned weapons are 5% more powerful.]<br>&nbsp;[Physical Based Magic and Skills are 5% more powerful]&nbsp;<br>[Unlocks unique <i>REDACTED</i> Skills.]</p>
<p>Thus picking this class instantly gives you 1.5 stat points worth of levels.</p>
