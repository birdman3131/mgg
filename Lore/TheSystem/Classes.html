<p>Most MG get 7 generic options to choose from. Though rarely extra Unique options will be given. “Achievements (as in what you achieve) determine what Classes you unlock.” Mikasane, Discord</p>
<p>Mai managed to unlock 10 classes, although as of ch.35 we don't know what any of them are.</p>
<p>The only class we know any MG has is <a href="/Characters/CutiePie">Cutie Pie's</a> Pastry Princess, level 126. &nbsp;It is a pretty good assumption that this is not one of the starting seven.<br><br>“Unique Classes generally are stronger and offer earlier specialization which allows for earlier refinement.” Mikasane, Discord</p>
<p>On discord at 7/16/2024 11:20 PM, Mika gave an example of a beginner class:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[+10 Strength, +5 Vitality]<br>[+1 Strength every 2 Class levels.]&nbsp;<br>[+1 Vitality and Agility every 4 Class levels.]<br>[Strength aligned weapons are 5% more powerful.]<br>[Physical Based Magic and Skills are 5% more powerful]&nbsp;<br>[Unlocks unique <i>REDACTED</i> Skills.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus picking this class instantly gives you 1.5 stat points worth of levels, as well as giving access to new skills and a small bonus to weapons, magic and skills. &nbsp;Also, it gives, on average 1 stat point per class level. &nbsp;Assuming that classes level up at about the same rate as levels (which is the case for Cutie), that is an increase of 10% of stat growth.</p>
