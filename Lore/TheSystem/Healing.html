<p>MG have access to a wide range of methods to care for their own, and others wounds. Such as items bought through vaults, or spells from grimoires.</p>
<p><br>“Magic always comes at a cost, and the cost of receiving magical healing is that your body will need nourishment.” Selene <a href="/redirects/ch26">ch.26</a></p>
<p><br>“Generally, items bought from Vaults aren’t as effective as magic from a Magical Girl anyway. They don’t have a caster with stats and Class bonuses to make the healing more efficient. If you ever have a choice, healing magic is almost always better than items.” Naiad <a href="/redirects/ch32">ch.32</a></p>
<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Healing Limit:</strong></span></p>
<p>“Healing magic isn’t something that can be done infinitely on somebody. As healing mana permeates the body, you become saturated with it to the point that more healing magic has a hard time finding purchase. Everyone has a set amount of healing they can receive before any further healing becomes much less effective. It isn’t impossible to heal somebody over the limit, but you have to spend much more mana and effort to get the same effect.” Naiad ch.32</p>
<p>Healing limit can be increased by Vitality.</p>
<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Full Dive Healing:</strong></span></p>
<p>“full-dive surgery, is instead of just saying the magic words and letting the spell heal you, basically, I narrowed down the scope of my attention to just the inside of your body. It’s kind of like I hyper focused, using a microscope to see all the tiny details of your anatomy. This allowed me to not cast healing spells at your body in general, but at the specific injured parts. I would see a broken bone and begin mending it, or a severed vein and stitch it back up. For every small tear or break in your body, I had to figure out the best healing spell and what intensity to cast it at all while focusing on keeping your vitals stable. I worked at a micro level instead of a macro one, working past your healing limit by casting the spells and focusing them to just heal one small issue instead of just throwing a spell at your body and trying to brute force it.</p>
<p>The full dive part comes from how much attention it takes from a healer to do it properly. In terms of mana and healing limit efficiency, it’s much better to do the micro-level healing, but we often don’t get that chance in combat.” Naiad ch.32</p>
