<p>Guardian Spire is the location from which MGs, Magical Soldiers, the police, and everyone else is coordinated. &nbsp;Whether it has command authority over MGs is not clear; &nbsp;it sort of does and sort of doesn't.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="/Characters/Error">Error Machina</a> works from.</p>
<p>The major feature we have seen is a large room that looks like a space mission control center, with a lot of people in front of computer monitors and a giant screen in front of the room.</p>
<p>In earlier editions of the story, known as Guardian Command spire, changed to simply Guardian Spire.</p>
