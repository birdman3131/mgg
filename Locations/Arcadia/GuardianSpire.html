<p>Guardian Spire, also known as Arcadia Spire, is the location from which MGs, Magical Soldiers, the police, and everyone else is coordinated. &nbsp;Whether the people there have command authority over MGs is not clear; &nbsp;it sort of does and sort of doesn't.</p>
<p>It is the tallest building in Arcadia, and also fairly wide. &nbsp;However, it is much larger on the inside, having many rooms that have been expanded using spacial magic. (<a href="/redirects/ch36">ch. 36</a>)</p>
<p>This is where <a href="/Characters/Error">Error Machina</a> works from.</p>
<p>“The Arcadia Spire was directly in the center of the city also made orienting yourself simple, the skyscraper of smooth angles, glass, and helipads standing out with a distinctly futuristic architecture.” &nbsp;<a href="/redirects/ch34">ch 34.</a></p>
<p>A major internal feature we have seen is a large room that looks like a space mission control center, with a lot of people in front of computer monitors and a giant screen in front of the room. <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch 25</a>.</p>
<p>The tavern on the tenth floor is designed to look like an adventurer's guild. &nbsp;(ch. 36)</p>
<p>Contains a teleportation ritual room, as do the spires in the other sanctuary cities and some other locations (Mikasane #mgg-general, 11/11/2024 1:12 PM).</p>
