<p>The location where basically all the the first arc takes place.</p>
<p>Mai described the appearance as “less of a mall and more of a sci-fi garden.”</p>
<p>Recently built using advanced magitech. Examples of which include an advanced sound suppression materials that keep the sound of gunfire relatively contained, or it’s fire suppression system.</p>
<p><br>Has shelters on every floor alternating what side of the building they are on.</p>

<p><br><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Incorrectly built things:</u></strong></span></p>
<p><br>Strange possibly guardian bought Manatech box on the mana generator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The mysterious box was leeching power from the mana generator. My guess is it’s a mana converter, turning mana into electricity like the shield station usually does. In other words, the mall was illegally siphoning power from the mana generator. That’s why the generator went down, and also why the shield station didn’t restart when you turned the generator back on. The shield station has the software and equipment to recognize there actually was tampering, so of course it didn’t automatically restart when you turned the generator back on.” Error ch.20</p>
<p>This box is essentially the underlying cause of everything in the first arc.</p>
<p><br>The doors on the top floor to access the shielding station area were two inches thinner then regulation.</p>
