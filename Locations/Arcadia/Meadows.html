<p>Meadow’s Track and Field Center, location of Mai's second usurpation, after the one in the Mall. &nbsp;Brief glimpse at end of <a href="/redirects/ch34">ch.34</a>, main action <a href="/redirects/ch35">ch.35</a>.</p>
<p><i>[The building is three stories. The largest area is the track, but there’s an attached workout gym with various weightlifting machines. The other rooms are a variety of specialty rooms with a few offices. The Seed is located on the second floor in what I believe to be a yoga room.] &nbsp;</i>Selene, ch.35.</p>
<p>"Examining it, I came to the simple conclusion that it was a <i>mess</i>.</p>
<p>Actual buildings, unlike game-designed dungeons, were filled with hallways, turns, and side rooms that could hold Anathema." &nbsp;Mai, ch.35</p>
