<h1>Overview&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Arcadia is the island megacity where the story has so far taken place. One of the seven of its kind on earth, that were built by the zenith and then gifted to humanity.</p>
<p>Arcadia is the home base for magical girls from United States, Canada, Auatrailia, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, and a few other spots. This means the primary population of Arcadia hails from those spots. Other sanctuary cities have other "service areas."</p>
<p>“Arcadia, has some districts that are in the distinct styles of the various places. Kind of like a Japan-town, Korea-town, etc.” Mikasane, Discord&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>Uses magitech shields to limit the severity of and frequency of Usurpations. Under normal circumstances (pre Ch.1) will have about half a dozen per month.</p>
<p><br>Like the rest of the island mega cities it has a very generous healthcare policy, with relatively easy access to zenith med tech.</p>
<p><br>Has free citywide wifi.</p>
<p><br>Houses one of the main Guardian Command Headquarters.</p>
<p>Houses an MG academy.</p>
<p>Given its source locations, English is the dominant language, although there are Zenith supplied translators available. &nbsp;Mika, discord #mgg-general 7/23/2024 11:24 PM.</p>
