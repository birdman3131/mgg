<h1>General Overview</h1>
<p>The story is set on earth, and has the same geography except for the mega cities built by and gifted to humanity by the zenith.</p>
<p>The mega cities Arcadia, Avalon, Atlantis, Elysium, Shangri-la, and Nirvana, are all built out in the ocean. The only one that differs is Eden that is a flying island. &nbsp;Each has a population upwards of 50 million. &nbsp;Each has an MG academy.</p>
<p>Mikasane gave the following on discord #word-of-god 4-21-2025 8:41 AM:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sanctuary City Member Nations/Service Areas</strong></p>
  <p>Avalon = Europe + Russia + Some Middle East<br>Arcadia = US + Canada + Japan + Indonesia + New Zealand + Phillipines (I think)<br>Nirvana = China<br>Shangri-La = India<br>Atlantis = Africa<br>Elysium = Mexico + South/Central America<br>Eden = Special. Random Leftover Mixture of Countries + Refugees + Retired Guardians and their families + Veteran MGs.</p>
  <p>Note: these are the BIGGEST countries/continents making up the cities members, some odd straggler countries might be in different cities due to politics or cultural beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
