<p>Fern is <a href="/Characters/Everglaive">Everglaive's</a> familiar.</p>
<p>She is “a hummingbird made of metal, its feathers made of blades.” (<a href="/redirects/ch36">ch. 36</a>)</p>
<p>Her voice is “a feminine voice that was a mix of wind rustling between the leaves and the gentle ringing of a drawn blade.” &nbsp;</p>
