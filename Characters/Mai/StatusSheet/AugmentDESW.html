<p><br>“Mai's augment costs 0 mana because it's how her Aspect bonus manifested. Aspect bonuses typically aren't Augments in the traditional sense, but Mai's is special due to her Dark Origin.” Mikasane. Discord</p>

<p>If Mai has looked at a map of a location, it can accurately depict it as well as update it in real time based on her location and the direction she is facing. Waypoint can placed be on it, as well as arrows can appear in her vision guiding her to the target.</p>
<p>Anywhere Selene scouts while summoned is filled out on the map in real time, and she can mark the location of Anathema or other targets of interest.</p>
<p>The targeting reticle is shaped as a black circle with a dot in the center that changes to red when targeting an Anathema. The circle will change to accurately predict the area her shots could land in real time. (Smaller when aiming, larger when moving etc.) Also adapts to the type of ammo being used such as shotgun.</p>
<p>Is the only known augment to have absolutely zero Mana cost to use. (As of ch35)</p>
<p>Shows the number of rounds in currently held gun.</p>
<p>Selene gave a minimum cost for augments that have similar but significantly more limited functions. 3000 points for a magic based one, and 5000 for a cybernetic. (Ch.6)</p>
<p><br><strong><u>More on Envy:</u></strong></p>
<p>“there are no Skills or spells in the entire System that allow somebody to get a direct level and name of an Anathema, let alone a Magical Girl. This isn’t just a rare ability, it is probably one entirely unique to you.” Selene ch.27</p>
<p>“you should be able to use your identify ability on a normal person, and if they are a Guardian, it would tell you their codename and level.” Selene ch.27</p>

<p><br><strong><u>Original Sin: Sloth</u></strong><br>“Oh, ye whom hath suffered, be at ease. Forsaken, spurned, ostracized… thy trials hast not been in vain. In thy heart, the Sloth Sin trills the song of slumber, eternal and sacrosanct. Yet, thou hast persevered and carried on through reproach and barb, through worry and woe. O Waif of Sable, awaken now the power that hath whispered truth and lie. Sing now thy song of sorrow, thy haunting melody. Open thy forbidden eye, the accursed source of scorn and enmity and SEE. Become in part the demon thou hast been painted, and find wretched aspect turned to peerless power.” ch.6</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Second Sin: Envy</u></strong></p>
<p>“As thy power grows, thy second sin reveals itself. To you who hath watched, who hast observed others and wondered what set thou apart, who hath desperately grasped for the normalcy of others, the Envy Sin opens a new eye. O Waif of Sable, let thy sight reveal all aspects to thee who yearns for what thou never may obtain. Witness the truths occulted from the world as only one who lives under the light of the Lonely Moon can.” Ch.27</p>
