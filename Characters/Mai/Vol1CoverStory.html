<p>Ch.11 Mai walked into the Mega Shelter injured, and out of costume. Given what the general populace know about MG’s they would never expect to see one like this, as such Selene considers Mai’s identity as an MG safe.</p>
<p><br>Mai was asleep for a week her family was told she was “recovering in a hospital after receiving an injury to your leg saving Brian.” And “being held to receive magical healing from a Guardian as the wound proved problematic.” Selene ch.26</p>
<p><br>“Officially, you snuck with Brian to the third floor shelter after encountering a hound that you dispatched without injury. Upon learning the emergency shield was activated, you went to the first floor, finding some Anathema patrolling outside the shelter’s entrance. You lured those into a store and set them on fire, freeing the way for you and Brian to make your way in. Unfortunately, an Anathema swiped your leg when you set off the trap, causing severe damage to your calf muscles. Because the damage would take weeks to heal and months of physical therapy, we’ve been keeping you in a hospital to be instantly healed by a Magical Guardian due to your heroics.” Ever ch.29</p>
<p><br>“A Magical Girl wouldn’t be injured and would be in their outfit. As for what’s in the folder, we have medical logs corroborating the story, an initial police report regarding the incident that you’ll have to finalize later, a damages report for you to fill out on what personal belongings were damaged or lost.” Ever ch.29</p>
