<p>Left arm amputated above elbow. <a href="/redirects/ch19">ch.19</a></p>
<p>limb was recovered and stored.</p>
<p>Reattached by <a href="/redirects/ch26">ch.26</a>.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery from extensive injuries from shielding station fight <a href="/redirects/ch24">ch.24</a>:</p>
<p>Ch.26 woke up after sleeping for a week with health at 83% (unchanged in <a href="/redirects/ch35">ch.35</a>), reason for lower health not explicitly explained,</p>
<p>Known relevant information. “Magic always comes at a cost, and the cost of receiving magical healing is that your body needs nourishment.” Selene ch.26</p>
<p>“I managed to fix all of the injuries you received, but it took the entire week to avoid putting too much of a drain on your body while I fully regenerated the damage to your lung and intestines. Organ damage always takes longer to repair properly than something like a broken bone or even a severed limb. your injuries should be fully healed, but if you have any problems like tingling or phantom pains, please let me know. I have quite a bit of experience doing these things so I don’t expect any issues, but it never hurts to be careful” Naiad <a href="/redirects/ch32">ch.32</a> this may or may not fully explain things but Mai has yet to ask about it.</p>
