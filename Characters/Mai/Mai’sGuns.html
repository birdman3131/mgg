<p>“A matte black pistol that looked… well, it looked pretty much like other guns I had seen. Sleek, metal, and if I was being honest with myself, cool. Something about its heavy but streamlined design did give it a more advanced look than some of the other guns I’d seen, however. The only other thing I noticed was “Umbra” embossed along the slide in silver along with a crescent moon symbol between the grip and the gun’s slide.” Mai ch.6</p>
