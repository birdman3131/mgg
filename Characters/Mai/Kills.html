<p>We know few levels from the Death Wish fight, or from the approach to it.</p>

<p>A unknown number of Anathema in the shield station battle, total 675 points. &nbsp;Known kills in shield station battle:</p>
<p>One ghoul, one hound, one hound wounded, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/DevouringBear">Devouring Bear</a> (15 pts, L 7), one killed and three wounded out of three hounds and a ghoul, a bear and five ghouls or hounds, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/FlailedShrieker">Flailed Shrieker</a> (30 pts, L 16), one hound, one ghoul, one hound, one ghoul, one hound, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/BladeReaver">Blade Reaver</a> (25 pts, L 14), one ghoul, one hound, one hound, one reaver, one spinethrower, two hounds, two wasps wounded, one lashbat, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/CrawlingNightmare">Crawling Nightmare</a> (50 pts, L 24) before flame trap.</p>
<p>An unknown number of Anathama in the flame trap.</p>
<p>After the flame trap, two ghouls and a hound, four fliers (probably wasps, maybe lashbats) wounded, an unknown number of unknowns, one ghoul and three unknowns (probably hounds or ghouls), a completely unknown number to blind shooting, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/HulkingMass">Hulking Mass</a> (20 pts, L 12).</p>
<p>Adding this up, we get 22 known + 3 probable hounds and ghouls (250), &nbsp;two bears (30), one shrieker (30), two reavers (50 pts), one lashbat (15 pts), one nightmare (50), one mass (20). &nbsp;Wounded: four hounds and ghouls (40), two wasps (10), four unknown fliers (20-60, most likely 20). &nbsp;Total known kills 33, known wounded 8.</p>
<p>All of the wounded eventually died, either by bleeding out, or killed by <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Teams/FantasyFatale">Fantasy Fatale</a>. &nbsp;Mai would only get points from the ones that bled out. &nbsp;Fantasy Fatale would get the points for the others. &nbsp;Total points from confirmed kills, 445, minimum points from known wounded, 70. &nbsp;This leaves 160 points from unknown kills. &nbsp;The system knows, and Selene might, but we don't and I don't think Mai cares. &nbsp;Total kills in this battle somewhere from 45 to 50.</p>
