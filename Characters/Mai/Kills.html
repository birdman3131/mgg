<p>Mai's kills,</p>
<p>Volume 1:</p>
<p>One <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/FomorianHound">Fomorian Hound</a> (10 pts), pre-contract.</p>
<p>One lone hound, on way to first floor shelter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Four hounds, two <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/ForsakenGhoul">Forsaken Ghouls</a> (10 pts), one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/GiantCavernWasp">Giant Cavern Wasp</a> (5 pts) in liquor store.</p>

<p>Two separate hounds, two separate ghouls, on way to mana generator.</p>
<p>One <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/Arachnomantis">Newborn Arachnomantis</a> (50 pts and four levels, to level 8), in mana generator room.</p>
<p>One <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/CorpseBlossom">Corpse Blossom</a> (10 pts), on way back from generator.</p>
<p>An unknown, large number of Kleenexes (0 pts) in Chapter 22.</p>
<p>Five hounds, three ghouls, two wasps, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/FomorianSpinethrower">Fomorian Spinethrower</a> (20 pts), one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/LesserLashbat">Lesser Lashbat</a> (15 pts), on way to the shield station.</p>
<p>A unknown number of Anathema in the shield station battle, total 675 points. &nbsp;Known kills in shield station battle:</p>
<p>One ghoul, one hound, one hound wounded, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/DevouringBear">Devouring Bear</a> (15 pts), one killed and three wounded out of three hounds and a ghoul, a bear and five ghouls or hounds, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/FlailedShrieker">Flailed Shrieker</a> (30 pts), one hound, one ghoul, one hound, one ghoul, one hound, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/BladeReaver">Blade Reaver</a> (25 pts), one ghoul, one hound, one hound, one reaver, one spinethrower, two hounds, two wasps wounded, one lashbat, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/CrawlingNightmare">Crawling Nightmare</a> (50 pts) before flame trap.</p>
<p>An unknown number of Anathama in the flame trap.</p>
<p>After the flame trap, two ghouls and a hound, four fliers (probably wasps, maybe lashbats) wounded, one ghoul and three unknowns (probably hounds or ghouls), a completely unknown number to blind shooting, one <a href="/Lore/Anathema/Species/HulkingMass">Hulking Mass</a> (20 pts).</p>
<p>Adding this up, we get 22 known + 3 probable hounds and ghouls (250), &nbsp;two bears (30), one shrieker (30), two reavers (50 pts), one lashbat (15 pts), one nightmare (50), one mass (20). &nbsp;Wounded: four hounds and ghouls (40), six wasps (30).</p>
<p>All of the wounded eventually died, either by bleeding out, or killed by Fantasy Fatale. &nbsp;Mai would only get points from the ones that bled out. &nbsp;Fantasy Fatale would get the points for the others. &nbsp;Total points from confirmed kills, 445, points from known wounded, 70. &nbsp;This leaves 160 points from unknown kills. &nbsp;The system knows, and Selene might, but we don't and I don't think Mai cares.</p>

<p>First Usurpation:<br>In track room: five hounds, four ghouls, three wasps (105 pts)<br>Late arrivals to track room: one ghoul, two hounds, three unknowns (probably hounds and ghouls) (60)<br>Outside track room: &nbsp;ghoul, hound, ghoul, blossom (40)<br>205 points total.<br>Magic Seed (0 pts, except for 50 pt quest completion)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
