<p>Every new MG gets a Welcome Package (swag) when they register for the first time at <a href="/Locations/Arcadia/GuardianSpire">Arcadia Spire</a>. &nbsp;Some get more than others; &nbsp;Mai got the “extended package”, which has more stuff than the basic package. &nbsp;This happened in <a href="/redirects/ch36">ch.36</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Items all MGs ge</strong>t:</p>
<p>Association-issued communicators: “They are advanced pieces of magitech, and fit into your ears like Bluetooth earbuds. These have a variety of useful functions beyond just allowing you to communicate with support personnel. … if they are damaged or lost, you'll have to pay for replacements.” <a href="/Characters/Edward">Edward&nbsp;</a> ch. 36.</p>
<p>Information on joining the <a href="/Lore/MGLore/GuardianAcademy">Guardian Academy</a>.</p>
<p>A bank account with an associated debit card.</p>
<p><strong>Items that Mai got that not all MGs get</strong>:</p>
<p>A card that gives a 100-point discount on a purchase from a crafting-focused Magical Girl.</p>
<p>A book containing a list of support Guardians and the services they offer. &nbsp; (Note: &nbsp;I don't know why everyone doesn't get this one, and wonder if Mika just forgot to list it.)</p>
<p>A "small card informing me that I would be gaining priority access to "AS:D" at the Guardian Academy (something Selene assured would be explained best at the academy, and that it would be incredibly useful)."</p>
<p>A waiver to claim any basic <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/AstralShift">Astral Shift </a>enchantment for free.</p>
<p>A voucher giving her one free meal a day from the tavern on the 10th floor of the Arcadia Spire.</p>
