<p>For info on <a href="/Characters/Mai/Mai’sHealthIssues">Mai’s longer term health issues</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre <a href="/redirects/ch1">ch.1</a>. Wound of unknown origin on her left arm rapped in gauze. She lies and tells Lily she was “burned by cooking oil.”</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Healed by ch. 11.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ch2. Severe organ damage caused by hound tongue. “made her organs look like then went through a blender”.</p>
<p>Short term heal by <a href="/redirects/ch17">ch.17</a> (reduced maximum health).</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/redirects/ch5">Ch.5</a> shortly after administering first aid, health was shown at 73% and Selene said that Mai’s “Health is still recovering, but should reach your current maximum soon.”</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/redirects/ch10">Ch.10</a> Bruising on left side from fall. Shallow laceration on right calf caused by Giant Cavern Wasp stinger.</p>

<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/redirects/ch18">Ch.18</a> assorted bruises, and twisted right ankle from Arachnomantis fight.</p>
<p>Functionally healed by <a href="/redirects/ch19">ch.19</a>.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ch.19 Fragmented bones in left forearm, wrist, and elbow.</p>
<p>Cause, Corpse Blossom ambush.</p>
<p>The extensive bone fragmentation caused severe internal bleeding, making a self administered field amputation above the elbow&nbsp; to be necessary to avoid bleeding out.</p>
<p>Health at 17% post amputation.</p>
<p>Amputated limb was retrieved and preserved using Zero Point Purchase, to be reattached at a later date.</p>
<p>Amputation site temporarily healed over by <a href="/redirects/ch21">ch.21</a>. &nbsp;Arm reattached and functional when Mai wakes up in ch.26.</p>

Two Broken ribs, cause blunt trauma to chest. Lacerated left bicep, cause, Lashbat tail. Punctured right lung, cause, Fomorian Spinethrower spine through ribs from behind.</p>

<p>Healed by<a href="/redirects/ch26"> ch.26</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Mai wakes up after the mall in ch.26, her health is 83%, and stays there through at least ch.35. &nbsp;We don't know why it is not 100%.</p>
