<p><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Broken Wings:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>Acquired <a href="/redirects/ch27">ch.27</a></p>
<p><strong><u>Reward:</u></strong> +10 Vitality</p>
<p><strong><u>Overview:</u></strong></p>
<p>A common Achievement that most MG will get at some point in their careers by getting injured selflessly. This Achievement is kept from those that don’t already have it, as it requires the injury be received not on purpose, but from trying to protect others.</p>
<p><strong><u>Flavor text:</u></strong></p>
<p>“In fighting the Anathema, you received multiple horrific, nearly fatal injuries to protect the lives of others and continued to fight on regardless. While being a Magical Girl is often portrayed as fantastical, there is very real danger that goes with it. You have discovered this much earlier than most through no fault of your own. Deprived of the very power that makes you a Magical Girl, how else could things have turned out? Though this will hardly make up for the trauma you endured, take this award and know your particular circumstances will NEVER happen to another.” Ch.27</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Seraph’s Halo:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>Acquired ch.27</p>
<p><strong><u>Reward:</u></strong> +5 Strength, +5 Dexterity, +5 Vitality, +5 Agility, +5 Willpower, +5 Spirit.</p>
<p>The stat bonus will upgrade at certain milestone levels. (What levels and upgrade amount unknown as of ch.35)</p>
<p><strong><u>Overview:</u></strong></p>
<p>A high tier Achievement with rewards that scale with you as you level.</p>
<p><strong><u>Flavor text:</u></strong></p>
<p>“You took on a Death Wish, succeeded, and survived. More impressively, you did so without utilizing your Astral Shift and only one arm. Fate, politics, and misfortune conspired against you, and yet you strode into the darkness anyway, fully ready to be the light necessary to save hundreds of people even if it meant sacrificing yourself. People may have failed you and forced you to fight without your Astral Shift, but you did not fail them. For these reasons, you have been awarded the Seraph’s Halo, one of the highest awards a Magical Girl can receive. Thank you for your service.”</p>

<p><br>“The reason Mai didn't get like 10 achievements is because the Seraph's Halo basically fused a bunch together to grant her the most powerful version.” Mikasane, Discord</p>
<p>“In the future Mai might accomplish something that she's technically already done and get an achievement for it. It's just the Halo looked at the entire Mall as one "incident" and went "Yup, this works."” Mikasane, Discord</p>
<p>“There's kind of a tier list for achievements, so you can get both lower tier ones like "Broken Wings" that give flat vitality, and you could get the higher tier version "Seraph's Shield" which would be like the halo and scale.” Mikasane, Discord</p>
