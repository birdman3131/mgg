<p>Fortune's Fool, an MG for whom <a href="/Characters/Error">Error Machina</a> &nbsp;identifies two anathema, a Winterbane Fiend and a Floran Deceiver, hiding in a store. &nbsp;She seems to be part of a team (and, indeed, Fortune's Fool might be her team name, but more likely her name) who are capable of taking out level 60 anathema.</p>
