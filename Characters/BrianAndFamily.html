<p>A young boy (grade school), first seen in <a href="/redirects/ch2">ch.2.</a></p>
<p>Mother Lucielle, father Jacob, sister Lucy. &nbsp;(Lucielle and Jacob <a href="/redirects/ch35">ch.35</a>, Lucy ch.2.)</p>
<p>He was separated from his parents and sister Lucy shortly before the usurpation, and was found by Mai hiding under a clothes rack in a sporting goods store about 5 minutes (out of 10) after the early warning system had gone off.</p>
<p>He is a fan of MGs and grows strongly attached to an expensive action figure of Carmine Crusader that was acquired for him by Mai in <a href="/redirects/ch4">ch.4.</a></p>
<p>End of Ch.35 Mai opened a letter from them that among other things contained:</p>
<p>“Please know that you are always welcome at our house, and do not hesitate to call if there is anything we can do for you.”</p>
<p>Letter included their phone number and address, and the following drawing made by Brian.</p>
<p>“It was a picture done in crayon. On it were two crudely drawn figures, stick figures except for the clothes they were wearing. The first was a boy, holding a smaller stick figure in his hands with a smile. The second was a girl, one eye a bright blue and the other an eyepatch. In one hand she held the boy’s free arm while the other held something like a pickaxe. On the ground next to them was a black colored dog-like creature with two red Xs for eyes. Finally, above the two figures were words written in crayon: <i>"Thank You!”</i></p>
