<p>A young boy (grade school), first seen in <a href="/redirects/ch2">ch.2.</a></p>
<p>he was separated from his parents and sister Lucy shortly before the usurpation. And was found by Mai hiding under a clothes rack in a sporting goods store about 5 minutes (out of 10) after the early warning system had gone off.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is a fan of MG’s and grows strongly attached to an expensive action figure of Carmine Crusader that was requisitioned for him by Mai in <a href="/redirects/ch4">ch.4.</a></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His last name is Palmer and the rest of his family’s are Mother Lucielle Palmer, father Jacob Palmer, sister Lucy Palmer.</p>
<p><br>End of <a href="/redirects/ch35">Ch.35</a> Mai opened at letter from them that among other things contained.</p>
<p><br>“Please know that you are always welcome at our house, and do not hesitate to call if there is anything we can do for you.” <a href="/redirects/ch35">Ch.35</a></p>
<p><br>Letter included their phone number and address, and the following drawing made by Brian.</p>
<p>“It was a picture done in crayon. On it were two crudely drawn figures, stick figures except for the clothes they were wearing.
The first was a boy, holding a smaller stick figure in his hands with a smile.
The second was a girl, one eye a bright blue and the other an eyepatch. In one hand she held the boy’s free arm while the other held something like a pickaxe.
On the ground next to them was a black colored dog-like creature with two red Xs for eyes.</p>
Finally, above the two figures were words written in crayon.</p>
<p><br><i>Thank You!” </i><a href="/redirects/ch35">Ch.35</a></p>
