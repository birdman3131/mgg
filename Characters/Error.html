<p><br><strong><u>Origin:</u></strong> <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Green">Green</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Level:</u></strong> well over 200, but under 300. &nbsp;(<a href="/redirects/ch25-5">Forum Interlude</a> states that Error is Third Tier.)</p>
<p>Error is a third generation MG. &nbsp;Mikasane discord #mgg-general &nbsp;09/10/2023 12:06 PM</p>
<p><br>He uses Digital Magic through the Arcadia network allowing control of almost any connected Magitech or mundane device, as well as the ability to cast spells, and create conjurations through those devices.</p>
<p>Uses a Magitech computer (cost 10,000p, edited from 5,000) as a focus</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Signature Magic:</u></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Digital Domain</strong></i></p>
<p>Allows him to “synchronize with and fully control any electronic device like it was an extension of his own body.” Error <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch.25</a></p>

<p><u>Spells</u></p>
<p><i>Find, Connect </i>(<a href="/redirects/ch22">ch. 22</a>)</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Other things of note:</u></strong></p>
<p><br>He was tasked with the censorship request caused by the blackmail video Katie took of Mai, because at the time he was the only person who both, already knew Mai’s identity, and had the relevant qualifications.</p>
<p><br>His mana signature feels like “a tingly sensation, like that of static electricity forming.” Ever <a href="/redirects/ch22">ch.22</a></p>
<p><br>Built a room in Guardian using just under 100,000 points that contains Magitech devices, ritual implements, enchantments, and runes designed to enhance his magic.</p>
<p><br>Friends with Everglaive for 6 years.</p>
<p><br>Has a mana regen of 3,510 per minute. &nbsp;Mikasane, discord, 7-21-2024 6:35 AM. &nbsp;This number has been described as various numbers (80+, 52+, 80+ again) in ch.22, before settling on 58.</p>
<p><br>Primarily works out of Guardian Spire as a Operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error's <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Familiars">familiar</a> is named Cipher, and has the appearance of “A green turtle whose shell looked like it was made from hexagonal LED screens. The Familiar wore a top hat, a monocle, and an impeccably curled mustache adorned his face like it was the most natural thing in the world.” Error ch.22</p>
<p><br>Interacted in the past with a Dark called Zero in an unknown capacity. Presumably he was ether close to her but exact details are unknown, with most information coming from a few comments, and this flashback</p>
<p>“a weeping girl wearing a black hospital gown in a dark, dingy warehouse. She stood in a pool of blood deep enough to cover her toes, four mangled bodies arrayed around her as she cried. Her bandage-covered hands were pressed over her face as she wailed, her wide eyes shaking as she peered between her fingers at Error’s horrified expression.</p>
<p>Zero.” Error <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch.25</a></p>
<p><br>Has a very good idea of what Darks true Origin is, but treats them nicely, and with respect.</p>
<p><br>Has a younger sister (unnamed) that he is very overprotective of.</p>
<p><br>Is very understanding of Mai’s circumstances, and has been very professional, while also trying to help her in anyway possible that won’t cross a line.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Personally:</u></strong></p>
<p>Usually a upbeat, passionate, caring older brother type that shows his emotions on his sleeve.</p>
<p>When dealing with the rougher aspects of being a MG, he looses most outward emotion and looks haunted.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“He wore a skintight suit in deep green with darker pieces of gleaming glass-like armor over his chest, shoulders, and gauntleted hands. Glowing lines of emerald lit up his outfit in a pattern almost like circuits, thrumming with light. His hair was another shade of moss green, but his face was covered by a completely featureless and slightly angular black mask made of a shining metal. There were no bumps, protrusions, or even eye holes on it, giving it an intimidating visage.”</p>
<p><u>Without his mask</u></p>
<p>“He was young looking, maybe in his early twenties, and had a light smattering of freckles across the pale skin of his nose and upper cheeks. What really drew my attention were his viridian eyes, the color somehow sharp without having the vividness of a manaborn’s. His pupils were shaped like square looking zeroes, and combined with his outfit, it gave him a futuristic and almost robotic look.” Mai ch.15</p>
