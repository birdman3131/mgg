<p>Leader of the strike team <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Organization/Teams/FantasyFatale">Fantasy Fatale</a>.</p>
<p><br>First seen <a href="/redirects/ch22">ch.22</a></p>
<p><br><strong><u>Origin:</u></strong> <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Green">Green</a></p>
<p><br><strong><u>Level:</u></strong> High 200s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Been a MG for six years. <a href="/redirects/ch32">ch_32</a> (This makes her a third generation MG.)</p>
<p>Nickname: &nbsp;Ever</p>
<p><br>Fights using her glaive as well as magic.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Signature Magic:</u></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Glade of Glaives</strong></i></p>
<p><u>Cost:</u> about 1700 mana.</p>
<p>Protects an area by surrounding it with metallic pine trees that are made out of glaives. The needle glaives can be fired at range while, the limb and root glaives can slash and stab.</p>
<p>There is some confusion here, because Glade is certainly her signature magic, but also seems to be a Fatale-class spell. &nbsp;One hopes this will be clarified at some point.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Other things of note:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/Lore/MGLore/Familiars">Familiar</a> is “a hummingbird made of wood and metal.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is a third generation MG. &nbsp;Mikasane discord #mgg-general &nbsp;09/10/2023 12:06 PM</p>
<p><br>Has over 5,000 mana, so her Willpower is over 500.</p>
<p><br>Very elegant and poised in her demeanor/speech/actions/interactions/etc.</p>
<p>Keeps a mask of “Graceful serenity” (Mai <a href="/redirects/ch28">ch.28</a>) in her interactions, and generally expresses herself using small movements and changes in facial expressions.</p>
<p><br>Ridiculously high social skills, is very quick to notice, and adapt to others communication needs.</p>
<p><br>“My team consists of a battle maniac, a guy with a heart of gold, and one of the most blue Magical Girls a Blue can be.” Ever about Fantasy Fatale ch.22</p>
<p><br>“Her magic would feel like brushing your skin against grass, but each of those were as sharp as razorblades, prickling not uncomfortably against the skin in a gentle scratch. Mikasane in Discord</p>
<p><br>Talented singer, frequently teams up with Naiad to put on concerts.</p>
<p><br>Friends with Error for 6 years.</p>
<p><br>Removes Blacklight Protocols from Mai almost immediately after they meet properly in <a href="/redirects/ch28">ch.28</a>.</p>
<p><br>Has past experience with Darks, the same one as Error though to a lesser extent, causing her to treat them well.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“She looked to be in her late teens or early twenties, wearing brown, tight fitting leather armor over dark green clothes. An emerald cloak wrapped around her, the hood pulled over her head. Her attire was reminiscent of a fantasy ranger’s except for the glaive she had resting across her shoulders. The pole of the glaive was made from an immaculately smooth, dark wood that led up to the wicked, single edged blade at its far end. The silver metal of the blade shone like liquid, an engraving of flowers delicately etched onto its otherwise unblemished surface.” 3rd person perspective ch.22</p>
<p>“Her long blond hair hung freely, but it failed to disguise her pointed ears and the smooth, ephemeral beauty of her face.</p>
<p>She looked like the picturesque example of an elven ranger, strong, beautiful, and utterly composed, as if nothing could so much as touch her.” Mai <a href="/redirects/ch24">ch.24</a></p>
<p>“Pine colored eyes with pupils the shape of a sharp edged flower.” Mai ch.28</p>
