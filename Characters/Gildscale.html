<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“a tall young man with dark skin, and he was covered in golden armor over dark clothing. He looked like a knight that had come straight out of a fantasy game, but instead of wearing plate armor, his armor was made of scales. His shoulder pieces were shaped like dragon heads, and the rest of the armor followed a similar theme, pointed and fierce looking with spikes and a vaguely draconic visage. His hair was shaved close to his scalp, and I only caught a glimpse of his chiseled features before he was twisting his body, raising a golden bow shaped like two wings.” Mai ch.24</p>
<p>“A man with dark skin covered in faint golden scales. He appeared to be in his early twenties with sharp, chiseled features and black hair shorn close to his scalp.” Mai ch.30</p>
