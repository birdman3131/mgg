<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“a tall young man with dark skin, and he was covered in golden armor over dark clothing. He looked like a knight that had come straight out of a fantasy game, but instead of wearing plate armor, his armor was made of scales. His shoulder pieces were shaped like dragon heads, and the rest of the armor followed a similar theme, pointed and fierce looking with spikes and a vaguely draconic visage. His hair was shaved close to his scalp, and I only caught a glimpse of his chiseled features before he was twisting his body, raising a golden bow shaped like two wings.” Mai <a href="/redirects/ch24">ch.24</a></p>
<p>“A man with dark skin covered in faint golden scales. He appeared to be in his early twenties with sharp, chiseled features and black hair shorn close to his scalp.” Mai <a href="/redirects/ch30">ch.30</a></p>
