<p>Warden code name Sanguine or guin for short.</p>
<p>Full name Tessa Kelly.<br><br>A warden squad leader.</p>
<p>first mentioned in <a href="/redirects/ch7">ch.7</a> by <a href="/Characters/Lily">Lily</a>.</p>
<p>First seen <a href="/redirects/ch34">ch.34</a></p>
<p><br>Pre ch.1 she met Lily during an Incursion. During which she taught Lily about incursions and shelters, as well as giving Lily her contact information.</p>
<p><br>Was contacted by <a href="/Characters/Everglaive">Everglaive</a> to train Mai on the usage of guns in combating Anathema.</p>
<p><a href="/redirects/ch35">Ch.35</a></p>
<p>Has a bit of a loud boisterous personality, and isn’t the type to mince words or be unclear about anything, but ends up handling Mai surprisingly well. (Unknown if that was on purpose though)</p>
<p><br>“Magical Girls do not have a monopoly on unique personalities, I suppose” selene <a href="/redirects/ch35">ch.35</a></p>
<p><br>A lover of guns and gun related things (this includes Mai).</p>
<p><br>Is at least on good terms if not friends with Ever. We know they have gone to a bar together in the past and then proceeded tested guns vs stats/aura (presumably while intoxicated). &nbsp;Calls Everglaive Glaivy.</p>
<p><br>“All I want in exchange for some training is a promise that you'll invite me to the duels, especially the first. Just thinking about it now has me excited. Just imagine it: some bratty girl who thinks she’s top of the world has been bothering you and finally gets you to accept a duel, and then… Oh lord, just imagine the look on her face when you pull a gun on her and she realizes she brought a sword to a gunfight!”</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“She wore a futuristic set of black armor that covered her from head to toe, all sleek curves and segmented plates that hugged her body tightly. It looked like something straight from a sci fi movie, some kind of close-fitting power armor that radiated danger. The helmet was designed more like a knight’s, a slim black visor where the eyes would be over the V-shaped faceplate. Dark red lines across the armor acted as accents, subtly emphasizing the woman’s tall and slim form.”</p>
<p>“A young woman’s face looked back at me with pale skin and freckles painted across her nose and upper cheeks. Her hair was colored scarlet, done up in a bun with a few strands escaping to frame her face, and her eyes were a matching red with the vivid sheen of a manaborn.” Mai <a href="/redirects/ch34">ch.34</a></p>
