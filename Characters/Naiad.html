<p>First seen <a href="/redirects/ch22">ch.22</a></p>
<p><br>Member of Fantasy Fatale.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Origin:</u></strong> “one of the most <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Blue">blue</a> Magical Girls a blue can be.” Ever ch.22</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Level:</u></strong> Just under 200</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Type:</u></strong> Healer/support</p>
<p>Fights using water magic.</p>
<p><br>A highly skilled healer, despite being under lvl 200 and not having the major benefits to the milestone she is still able to heal extremely severe injuries such as “a Guardian that was cut into 3 pieces” Ever ch.25</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Other info:</u></strong></p>
<p><br>Introverted, and somewhat socially awkward, but is a gentle upbeat person.</p>
<p><br>Extremely kind, and caring sometimes to her own and others detriment.</p>
<p><br>“Whenever she wasn’t directly fighting Anathema, Naiad was out patrolling hospitals, healing as many people as she could until she was literally falling asleep on her feet. It was a fairly common occurrence that Ever had to force the younger girl to take breaks and recharge herself.”</p>
<p>“Naiad might have been younger and under the level 200 milestone, but Ever still trusted her more than any other healer she’d worked with. Even if Naiad didn’t have confidence in herself, Ever believed in her.” Ever <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch.25</a></p>
<p><br>On her first patrol she “froze solid before turning and sprinting off into the distance.” (Ever <a href="/redirects/ch34">ch.34</a>) when a group of people formed for autographs.</p>
<p><br>Plays violin and dances, frequently teams up with Everglaive to put on concerts.</p>
<p><br>Likes cute things (especially girls) and “listening to some piano and rain sounds while reading a good book.” Naiad ch.34</p>
<p><br>Her mana signature feels like “a whirlpool opening up in an endless, beckoning maw that stretched to the bottom of the ocean itself.” Ever ch.22</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>She looked to be in her late teens with a slender, delicate build. Her skin was a pale blue color, and white cloth with intricate aqua colored embroidery wrapped around her in a short, toga-style dress. Her aqua hair was long and unbound, gently flowing like gentle waves of water as she moved, a trident of blue crystal clutched in her hand. Each of her steps made the short skirt of her dress flutter with a gentle grace around her long legs, the leather sandals that laced up all the way to her thighs only emphasizing her delicate beauty. Everglaive ch.22</p>
