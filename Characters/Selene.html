<p>Named after. The Greek goddess and personification of the moon.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Pre contract:</u></p>
<p>“A pure white, floppy-eared rabbit sat near my head, staring at me with red eyes. The rabbit was huge, the size of a fully grown cat, and even as I looked at it, nine fox tails unfurled behind it, gently waving back and forth. As I looked at the thing in confusion, I noticed that instead of solid pupils, both were black circles that held a seven-pointed star made of seven straight, overlapping lines. Everything about it was overemphasized and artificially perfect, exactly like a stuffed animal was.” Mai ch.2</p>
<p><u>Post contract:</u></p>
<p>“Her pure white visage had changed. Near the tips of each of her tails and ears was a swath of black fur that formed a ring. Between her eyes, more black fur had formed the symbol of a crescent moon, and her previously heptagram-shaped pupils had changed to match.” Mai ch.3</p>
