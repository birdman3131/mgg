<p>Zero was a dark MG whom something tragic happened to, with several dead bodies. &nbsp;The details and Zero's fate are unknown, but <a href="/Characters/Error">Error Machin</a>a is still broken up about it. &nbsp;<a href="/redirects/ch22">ch. 22</a> &amp; <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch. 25</a></p>
<p>“And finally, a weeping girl wearing a black hospital gown in a dark, dingy warehouse. She stood in a pool of blood deep enough to cover her bare toes, four mangled bodies arrayed around her as she cried. Her bandage-covered hands were pressed over her face as she wailed, her wide eyes shaking as she peered between her fingers at Error’s horrified expression.” ch. 25</p>
