<p><br>Fights using some sort of space magic that creates portals along where she cuts with her sword.</p>

<p>Mourning is a second year MG. &nbsp;Mikasane on spacebattles 09/14/2024.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“She wore a samurai-esque outfit with a ragged black cloak draped around her body. She wore a large, conical bamboo hat dyed the color of shadows, its brim hanging low enough to cover the upper half of her face. In her hand was an oversized katana, the guardless hilt wrapped in black, bandage-like cloth while the jagged blade was almost longer than Breakdance was tall. Dark Anathema blood flowed through small indents on the sword, filling up sharp-edged symbols that seemed to whisper with malice.”</p>
<p>“She was Asian, perhaps in her mid to late teens with thin, severe features. Her eyes were the color of silver, the pupils ragged, vertical slits like the edge of her katana. Her skin was a pale gray, almost corpse colored.” Breakdance ch.25</p>
