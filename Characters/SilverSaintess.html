<p>Over level 500.</p>
<p>Contracted the first year of the incursion.</p>
<p>Started as a <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/Yellow">yellow</a>, changed to <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/Origins/White">white</a> after three years.</p>
<p>Extensive explanation in <a href="/redirects/ch36">ch.36</a>.</p>
<p>Saintess's signature magic allows her to rebuild her body if it is destroyed and she has enough mana. &nbsp;She has died many times. &nbsp;Many, many times.</p>
<p>Mikasane explained this on discord: "It's actually a type of semi-temporal magic. Basically, if my physical body is destroyed or I want to activate my Signature, my magic rewinds my soul back to my last checkpoint. From there, my soul's "memory" of my physical state when I was at said checkpoint is reinstated using mana. I say semi-temporal because it only rewinds my soul's location back to the last checkpoint, not it's state, which allows me to keep my memories of what happened." &nbsp;(<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1105530647637934130/1105551065878892614/1204418738821013588">Discord, #mgg-general, 2/6/2024 8:30 AM</a>)</p>
