<p>First seen <a href="/redirects/ch1">ch.1</a></p>
<p>A girl who goes to the same school as Mai. She is something like the queen bee in the school, she frequently bullies Mai, and gets others to do the same, or to at least shun her.</p>
<p>She had a blackmail video of Mai -what it contained is currently unknown- that was taken approximately one week before Ch.1. Error Machina deletes said video after it was caught by the Zenith.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“The American girl next to me had perfectly curled blond hair flowing down to her shoulders. Her Japanese-style high school uniform was identical to mine, an onyx blazer with silver trim covering most of her white button-up blouse. The skirt matched the blazer, thin silvery lines forming a checkered pattern. Around her neck, a blue bow marked her as being a first year high school student like me.</p>
<p>As far as looks went, she was a natural beauty. Her generous curves combined with the perfect smoothness of her face, driving most of the guys in class crazy for her. Even her viridian eyes had a vibrant brightness to them. In all, Katie Bennet was the perfect American beauty.</p>
<p>If only she weren’t such a bitch.” Mai ch.1</p>
<p>Katie and Mai went to the same middle school. &nbsp;Mika, discord, patreon-discussion 10/29/2024 2:13 pm.</p>
