<p>She is of Australian heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to her sports/track abilities is very popular in school, as well as mostly immune to Katie’s bullying.</p>
<p>Carries a questionably legal switchblade.</p>
<p>Bad with directions, or as Mai says in ch.2 “you can’t even navigate in video games with a mini-map that shows your location.”</p>
<p><br>First met Mai before Ch.1 when Mai gave her a can of juice at a time when Lily was struggling with interpersonal relationships with other track members.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“She had on the same uniform as me, but her blazer was tied around her waist. As one of the best members of the track team, she was built with lean, defined muscle that only enhanced her casual beauty. Slender and modestly curved, she carried herself with a confidence I envied. Her sunflower blond hair was in its regular ponytail, but it was her mischievous sky blue eyes I was fixed on.” Mai ch.1&nbsp;</p>
