<p>Cipher</p>
<p><a href="/Characters/Error">Error Machina</a>'s <a href="/Lore/MGLore/Familiars">familiar</a>.</p>
<p>“A green turtle whose shell looked like it was made from hexagonal LED screens. The Familiar wore a top hat, a monocle, and an impeccably curled mustache adorned his face like it was the most natural thing in the world.” <a href="/redirects/ch22">ch. 22</a></p>
<p>Although described as a turtle, Cipher is actually a tortoise. &nbsp;Mikasune, discord, #patreon-discussion, 10-21-2024, 5:49 pm.</p>
