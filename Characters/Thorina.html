<p><br>“She didn’t mean any harm. She just sometimes doesn’t use her brain. Or, ever does, really.” Naiad ch.30</p>
<p><br>“I mean, yes, I’m a hopeless battle maniac, but there’s nothing wrong with that. And I do have a hobby! It’s figuring out how to kill Anathema as efficiently as possible! And leveling! Those count, right?” Rina ch.30</p>

<p><br>Frequently gets roasted by her teammates.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“The girl appeared to be in her mid to late teens and was short enough to barely be taller than me. She wore a complicated short sleeved dress with a puffy skirt and sleeves. The color scheme was white and black as a base while a red diamond pattern dominated the edges, tapering off near her stomach. Red and black thigh-high socks following the same checkered diamond pattern covered her legs, but I couldn’t see what she wore on her feet from my position. Red bows and ribbons adorned her dress, and a scarlet headband rested on her head with lightning bolt shaped pins rising off it”</p>
<p>“she had startlingly blue eyes with pupils in a thunderbolt pattern.” Mai ch.30</p>
<p>“She was small and wore a short, white and black dress with an overwhelming amount of red accents and patterns that dominated the color scheme including a short red cape. The skirt puffed out around her thighs, red and black checkered thigh-high socks covering her legs and leading down to complicated red sandals with small heels. Her blonde hair was tied into two pigtails with red ribbons tied into bows, and as she rose, she lifted what looked like a red rubber mallet with a large, cylindrical head.” Mai ch.24</p>
