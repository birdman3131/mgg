<p><br><strong><u>Level:</u></strong> 40’s</p>
<p><br>Fights in melee range by dancing to music he creates with magic.</p>
<p><br>His signature Magic is a charge type. By continuously dancing he can build up energy to use for various things such as a melee attack that releases stored energy. If he stops dancing for any reason he loses the charge.</p>
<p><br>During the conversation with <a href="/Characters/MourningEdge">Mourning Edge</a> despite being relatively terrified he tended to speak to her politely, though with little self control as he let his tongue get ahead of his brain a bit.</p>
<p><br>He thought of Mourning Edge as “kind of cute in the “scary goth samurai who could totally murder you and nobody would ever know” kind of way.” Breakdance <a href="/redirects/ch25">ch.25</a></p>
<p><br>His familiar speaks in rhymes.</p>
