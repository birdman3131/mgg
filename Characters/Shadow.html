<p>Shadow is a magical construct based in Mai's soul gem, designed to help Mai deal with trauma. &nbsp;She fully manifests when Mai unlocks her <a href="/Lore/TheSystem/SignatureMagic">signature</a> in <a href="/redirects/ch37">ch. 37</a>.</p>
<p>All MGs, indeed all magic users eventually develop a shadow. &nbsp;“Magic is creation fueled by magical energy. Emotions can create magical energy. Live long enough, bury enough subconscious desires and feelings, and eventually enough is fed into the creation of a magical construct to ask the questions you refuse to directly answer. For a natural magic user, this process can lead to… complications. Thankfully, due to the Zenith’s Soul Gem, there are safeguards to help prevent any accidents from happening.” &nbsp;(Shadow, ch 37.)</p>
<p>I suspect that all shadows are named Shadow, but since each is tied to a particular MG, this should not be a problem.</p>
<p>An extensive explanation of Shadow is given in chapter 37. &nbsp;We earlier saw Shadow, without explanations, in chapters <a href="/redirects/ch3">3</a>, <a href="/redirects/ch14">14</a>, and <a href="/redirects/ch20">20</a>. &nbsp;See <a href="/Characters/Mai/Mai’sDreams">Mai's dreams</a> for a description of these earlier encounters.</p>
