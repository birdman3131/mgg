<p><br>“the perfect teacher. She was warm and kind, and always dressed in clothes that matched her personality, like the simple blue dress and yellow cardigan she was currently wearing. Her face was round and soft, and lent to her empathetic impression. She had an uncanny knack for understanding what was going on, and more than once Lily had been caught off guard by her teacher’s insight. Really, she was completely the opposite of Mai’s useless homeroom teacher.” Lily ch.7</p>
<p><br>Has been shown to be good in an emergency and at taking charge of situations. Maximum level people skills. While a patent person she has limits with idiots (Mr. Toujou).</p>
