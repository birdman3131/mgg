<p>First seen ch.1</p>
<p><br>He is rather young, a relatively recent college graduate, with a rich family.&nbsp;<br>While Mai likes his teaching style, he seems lack any sense of social awareness, and completely ignores Mai being bullied, despite Mai herself bring it to his attention.</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Other info:</u></strong></p>
<p><br>Lily thinks of him as a “useless idiot”</p>
<p><br>During the fight to keep a security guard from activating the shelters emergency shield in ch.7. He activates the shield while everyone is busy subduing said security guard.</p>
<p><br>“There is a levy of possible charges he could be tried with. Criminal negligence for turning the shield on when he knew people were still outside is possible, but his lawyers might argue he acted with reasonable care to protect the students in the shelter due to the rarity of the Anathema he encountered. Involuntary manslaughter is a possibility for the deaths of the police officers who went to turn on the mana generator, but his lawyers would argue the true fault lies with the mall owners.”</p>
<p>“What he will be charged and convicted of is felony shelter operation for activating the emergency shield against the automated system’s recommendation, resulting in civilians or rescue personnel being put into danger, injured, or killed. It more or less covers the previous two charges, and there is no doubt he violated that particular law. With all the facts of the case, I would guess he gets a maximum of ten years in jail and a fine he will be paying off the rest of his life. It’s possible he takes a plea deal down to just the fine and parole depending how much his lawyers can leverage the extenuating circumstances including the fight that broke out, but we’ll see.” Ever ch.29</p>
<p><br><strong><u>Appearance:</u></strong></p>
<p>“He was young, his dark hair pulled back into a ponytail that revealed his handsome features. His glasses and crisp, slightly messy suit gave him a scholarly look while still remaining casual. Combined with his youth and passionate rambles, I knew that at least half the girls in class had a crush on him to some degree.” Mai ch.1</p>
